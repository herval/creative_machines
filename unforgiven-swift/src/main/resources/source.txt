It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

All this time I was wasting,
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

Looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no, oh

You're not sorry no no oh

You had me crying for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, no no oh

You're not sorry, no no oh

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

You belong with me.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.


He said, "Let's get out of this town,
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
I thought heaven can't help me now.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh, ah, wildest dreams, oh, ah.

I said, "No one has to know what we do,"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound,
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh, ah, wildest dreams, oh, ah.

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend) wildest dreams, oh, ah, in your wildest dreams, oh, ah
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, oh, ah, in your wildest dreams, ah, ah.


Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl,
I should have known, I should have known

[Chorus:]
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Baby I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

[Chorus:]
I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York

New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright 
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York 
Welcome to New York


I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together,
We are never ever ever getting back together,
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever...

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together


Untouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
But you're untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Oh, oh I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh oh

Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

Like a million little stars, spelling out your name
Spelling out your name


Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away,
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow,
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it


He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie."


Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, cause I know you...

[Chorus:]
Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go... and no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay
Not his price to pay...

[Chorus x2]

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone... oh
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby


Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams,
in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you're still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip,
oh, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]

Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]


He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
I couldn't ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
He's close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
He's charming and endearing 
And I'm comfortable 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He can't see the smile I'm faking 
And my heart's not breaking 
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now 

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
I'm so in love that I acted insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you


I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
How we met and the sparks flew instantly,
and people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.

Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to fall-out.
So many things that I wish you knew,
So many walls up I can't break through.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

Next chapter.

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
And you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
But you held your pride like you should've held me.

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how,
I've never heard silence quite this loud.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

This is looking like a contest,
Of who can act like they care less,
But I liked it better when you were on my side.
The battle's in your hands now,
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight.
So many things that you wish I knew,
But the story of us might be ending soon.

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
And we're not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

The end.


I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

[Chorus:]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

[Repeat Chorus]

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
I mean it, I mean it."
What I mean is...

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you


You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.



New to town with a made up name in the angel city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.
You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...

Now it’s big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that you’re lucky.
But you’re so confused,
Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you’ll make it out alive.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

‘Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh


[Gary Lightbody:]
I find myself at your door,
Just like all those times before,
I'm not sure how I got there,
All roads—they lead me here.

I imagine you are home,
In your room, all alone,
And you open your eyes into mine,
And everything feels better,

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why,
Just you and me.

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.

[Taylor Swift:]
You find yourself at my door,
Just like all those times before,
You wear your best apology,
But I was there to watch you leave,

And all the times I let you in,
Just for you to go again,
Disappear when you come back,
Everything is better.

[Both:]
and right before your eyes,
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide,
Just you and me...

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...

[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time I let you in my door,
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.

Oh, oh, oh,

This is the last time I'm asking you this,
Put my name at the top of your list,
This is the last time I'm asking you why,
You break my heart in the blink of an eye.

[4x:]
This is the last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you,
Last time I'm asking you this...


I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today



I took a chance, I took a shot 
And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not 
You took a swing, I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
And here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what i'm trying to say, oh 

I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me, then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you're around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why.. 

Why..do you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside 
Why..do you have to put down my dreams 
So you're the only thing on my mind 

I'm sick and tired of your attitude 
I'm feeling like I don't know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
I'm sick and tired of your reasons 
I've got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Here's to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you're doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why, tell me why 

I take a step back, let you go 
I told you i'm not bulletproof 
Now you know



Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,
And she's got everything that I have to live without.

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny [radio version]
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny [CD version]
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus:]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]

So I drive home alone.
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight.

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into.

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.


This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar



Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you? "
I say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around...
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

When you come back down


Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style.

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home
(out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style


I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
But you stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Who took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to:

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.

You took the time to memorize me:
My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you, all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave;
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life.

Stay.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

[Background:] This song is so fun!


Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

[Chorus:]
You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way...

[Chorus]

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold,
At least you'll know...

You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for,
I hope your love lead you back to my front door.
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na


I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I’ve loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) {[x8:] Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right


I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window,
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?



I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me,
Don’t you?

[Chorus:]
Don’t say "Yes", run away now,
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
Don’t wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
Don’t say "Yes", run away now,
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
Don’t wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I’m only looking at you.

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus:]
So, don’t say "Yes", run away now,
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
Don’t wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Let’s run away now,
I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didn’t say my vows,
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."


The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something,
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

Drop everything now,
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...


Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Halleluia!
Halleluia!
Halleluia!

Christ the savior is born


It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus:]
You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, with what you did with her,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

[Chorus]

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this:
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No... no, no, no...

[Chorus]


I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates [chuckle]
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off


Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had – a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair


[Verse 1:]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2:]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge:]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus:]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Post-Chorus:]
And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street



State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
[Album version line:] That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
[Music video version line:] That's fine you won't mind if I say
By the way...

[Chorus:]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn!

There's no time for tears,
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]

And if you're missing me,
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard,
I really really hate that...

[Chorus]

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...



Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking…

[Chorus 2x:]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance,
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

[Chorus 2x]

(Are we out of the woods?!)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me,
I remember, oh, I remember

[Chorus 4x]


I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

[Chorus:]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song



Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder that I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up


Uh, oh, oh
Uh, oh, oh

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin’
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we’re lying on the couch
The moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter.
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine.

Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together,
And there’s a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I’m guarded,
You say we’ll never make my parents’ mistakes.

But we got bills to pay,
We got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine.

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine.

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the "Goodbye."
‘Cause that’s all I’ve ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I’ll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, it’s like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter.
She is the best thing that’s ever been mine."

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine.

(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(Hold on) and I can see it,
(Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...)


You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down with just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?...

Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I...
Oh my my my my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my...

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my...


We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello, "
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me,
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh.

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes".

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you


I said remember this moment in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment, promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered



I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last...



Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special

Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special



I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby

You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh

I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me

And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would



She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.
She’ll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by.

And you can’t see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me.

[Chorus:]
I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you,
She's never gonna love you like I want to.
And you just see right through me.
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

There’s a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through.
She’s never gonna see the light
No matter what you do.

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we’re invisible.
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize.

I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you.
Baby, let me love you,
Let me want you.
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle,
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible.

She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile.



I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been.
You're still an innocent,
You're still an innocent.

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did.
You're still an innocent.

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent.
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent.
You're still an innocent.

Lost your balance on a tightrope.
It's never too late to get it back.



Friday night beneath the stars,
in a field behind your yard,
you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.
And sometimes we don't say a thing;
just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side.
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you.

[Chorus:]
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.

Just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world.
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
And I don't try to hide my tears.
The secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
And you know everything about me.
You say that you can't live without me.

[Chorus]

When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
Only you can tell.

[Chorus:]
That I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
Uh huh
Yeah



You stand with your hand on my waist line
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out 

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time 

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places 

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found 
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places


[Music video spoken part:]
I think--I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Music video spoken part:]
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.


Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me,
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose"

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there,
If you're somewhere,
If you're moving on,
I've been waiting for you.
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
And I say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now



I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess, babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.


Oh Oh Oh.
Oh-oh.

Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say "Are you insane ('ane)?"
Say it's been a long 6 months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.

And that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl.
And then you say.

I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I would wait forever and ever.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...

Remind her how it used to be (Yeah, yeah)
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (Uh-uh)
And you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).

And that's how it works.
That's how you lost the girl.
And now you say

I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever).

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)

And you could know (Oh-oh Oh Oh)
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..

Remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
And say you want me.
Yeah...

And then you say,
I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I want you forever and ever.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl.
Oh.
[x4]

That's how it works.
That's how you got the girl.


I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light "Go".
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’,
And for the first time I had something to lose,
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the story’s got dust on every page,
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.

Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you,

It was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.


Hey Stephen,
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you.
And as we walked
We were talking –
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey Stephen,
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Hey Stephen,
I've been holding back this feeling.
So I've got some things to say to you, ha.
I seen it all –
So I thought –
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name –
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey Stephen,
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

[Chorus]

They're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.

Hey Stephen,
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose.
All those other girls –
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus:]
I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself...
...if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.

Myself,
Can't help myself,
I can't help myself.


You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No.

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it...



Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.


Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah


You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know I haven't seen you around, before"

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and hes got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're mommas waiting up and you think hes the one
And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through those doors.


There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss,
It's flawless,
Really something,
It's fearless.

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah


[Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Ed Sheeran]
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[Taylor Swift (Album version) / Ed Sheeran (Remix version):]
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
[Album version:] Taking flight, making me feel right
[Remix version:] Taking flight, making me feel right like

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Bridge]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind.

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello."
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed



There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
It was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you


Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won’t fall through, again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin’ which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin’ up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home, I should've known.

Well maybe it’s me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it’s you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don’t you think nineteen’s too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so, I should've known.

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don’t look now
I’m shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you should’ve known.

You should’ve known
Don’t you think I was too young?
You should’ve known.


I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus:]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]

Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier.



I could go back to every laugh,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore,
And I know all the steps up to your door,
But I don't wanna' go there anymore.

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky,
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
And let me know what you find.

I’ll leave my window open,
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name.
Just know I’m right here hopin’,
That you’ll come in with the rain.

I could stand up and sing you a song,
But I don’t wanna’ have to go that far.
And I, I’ve got you down,
I know you by heart,
And you don’t even know where I start.

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears,
Talk to the man who put you here,
And don’t wait for the sky to clear.

I’ll leave my window open,
‘Cus I’m too tired at night to call your name.
Oh, just know I’m right here hopin’,
That you’ll come in with the rain.

I’ve watched you so long,
Screamed your name,
I don’t know what else I can say.

But I’ll leave my window open,
‘Cus I’m too tired at night for all these games.
Just know I’m right here hopin’,
That you’ll come in with the rain.

I could go back to every laugh,
But I don’t wanna’ go there anymore…



You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself don't get attached,
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can put this down,
If I had known what I'd known now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in London today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

New York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here.
Come back... be here.


You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted

[Chorus:]

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

[Repeat Chorus]

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
(Died for you)

Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you



I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing 
For me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

Before I met him 
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me


The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

10 months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Think I'm finally clean



What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial?
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more



Please take down the misletoe
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine



And it’s a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I’ll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah

So we’ve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We’re getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we’re faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don’t need this
But there’s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It’s a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sang hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah



Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?



I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say 
I'm looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And i still love you
By the way
By the way, oh


Emily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was some way
To make them stop it."
So he drives down to
That principles office and says,

"I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said,

"I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out.
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, "It's officer Tate."
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily – she's fading fast."

He says, "God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
She wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes


Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'­d want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless


I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.

Ohhh

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

I'm sorry (oh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry (eh eh)
I'm sorry (mmm)
I'm sorry


Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name



"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"

Ha!
Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you
To roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't
Make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
Come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"


I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, 
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better


Her hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you, she'll unease you
Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you when she snows you
She knows you, she's got Bette Davis Eyes



All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby


Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again


Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
and sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why
i want to be somewhere where you are
I want to be where...

[Chorus:]
You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while... I'll cry
Cause you're my lullaby
SO baby come hold me tight cause I-I
I want to be everything you need
I want to be where...

[Chorus]

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about
Dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyes


[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah
Follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars
Body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge - Taylor Swift (Kendrick Lamar):]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
(Think we can solve 'em!)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus - Taylor Swift:]
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
(Look what you've done)
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey!


'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
(Hey)

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey




I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever,
We small talk, work and the weather,
Your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
Realized I loved you in the fall.

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time.

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry.

Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time.
All the time.



I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean,
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say,
Do you say what you mean?
When you say our love could last forever

Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

Oh, yeah, yeah

You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow


I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus:]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's ok

[Chorus]

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh,
Oh I'm just a girl


[Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away.
It don't make sense to me, but:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore.
How do I get it back the way it was before?

[Chorus 2:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

[Repeat Chorus 1:]
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?


Sometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love



Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl


American boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the dream of an american boy

American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy



People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Let me remind
You this was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay



I walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,
And you've still got it in your drawer even now.

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
And I can picture it after all these days.

And I know it's long gone,
And that magic's not here no more,
And I might be okay,
But I'm not fine at all.

'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to...

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much,
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well



I wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy, 
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

[Chorus]

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right now



All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks 
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not cause were just sitting here
Ans we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird 
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on youtube

Cause, Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing



The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

wahooahoo

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me


If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at karma's burning
Or look ahead but keep on turning?

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

You live it or lie it (x4)

My lifestyle determines my deathstyle 
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle

Keep searching. Keep on searching 
This search goes on, This search goes on 
Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, This search goes on

Frantic-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock (x4)

I've worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
This Frantic-tick-tick-tick-talk of hurry

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made

You live it or lie it (x4)

My lifestyle determines my deathstyle 
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle 

Keep searching, Keep on searching 
This search goes on, This search goes on
Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, On and on

Frantic-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock (x4)

Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to do what I shouldn't know?
Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to do what I shouldn't know?

My lifestyle determines my deathstyle (Birth is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side (Life is pain)
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle (Death is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side (It's all the same)

Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, On and on
Keep searching, Keep on searching
This search goes on, On and on

Frantic-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tock (x4)

Some Kind Of Monster

These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more

These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the God that ain't so pure
This is the God that is not pure
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people? (x2)

Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
This monster lives

This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more

This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people? (x2)

Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
This monster lives

This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone

Ominous
I'm in us (x4)

This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone

Ominous
I'm in us (x4)

Are we the people?

Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster...
Some kind of monster ..
The monster lives

Invisible Kid

Invisible Kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible Kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

Invisible Kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible Kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside
But I'll show you...

I'm ok, just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm ok, just go away
I'm ok, but please don't stray too far

Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm being right here, right now (x2)

Oooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Oooh, can't you see that he's not here?
He doesn't want the attention you give
Oooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible Kid, floats alone in his room
Oooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around in himself

My World

The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead
It's my world now
It's my world now
It's my world... 
It's my world.......!

Mama, why's it rainin' in my room?
Cheer up boy! Clouds will move on soon!
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride!

It's my world
You can't have it
It's my world, It's my world
It's my world

Sucka!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out!

Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancin' devils in angels way

It's my time now
It's my time now
It's my time... 
Yeah, it's my time.......!

Look out motherfuckers here I come!
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world
You can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world

Sucka!

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out!

Not only do I not know the answer..
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS!! (x2)

Shoot Me Again

I won't go away
Right here I'll stay

Stand silent in flames
Stand tall 'till it fades

Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet (x4)

Shoot me again
Shoot me again
Shoot me!
Shoot me again
Shoot me again
C'mon! (x2)

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots..
All the shots...

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I won't go away
With a bullet in my back! 
Right here I'll stay
With a bullet in my back!

Shoot me...
Take a shot
Shoot me...
Take a shot
Shoot me...
Take a shot
Shoot me...
Take a shot

I'll stand on my own
With a bullet in my back! 
I'm stranded and sold
With a bullet in my back!

Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet (x4)

Shoot me again
Shoot me again
C'mon!
Shoot me again
Shoot me again
C'mon! (x2)

All the shots I take

All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots..
All the shots...

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back
No compromise
My heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant
Wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog
No, let him sleep

I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back...

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you

All the shots..
All the shots...

All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take

Sweet Amber

Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine

Oooh then she hold my hand
And I lie to get a smile (x2)

Using what I want
To get what you want (x4)

Ooh, sweet amber

How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get? (x2)

Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over, 'till I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away, but I'm back again

Oooh, then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile

Using what I want
To get what you want (x4)

Ooh, sweet amber

How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get? (x2)

She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in (x2)

Ooh, sweet amber...
Ooh, sweet amber

How sweet are you?
Oooh, how sweet does it get? (x2)

It's never as sweet as it seems!





The Unnamed Feeling

Been here before (x6)

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive... 
It comes alive...
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive...
It comes alive...
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before (x6)

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart, hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it'll be here soon

It comes alive... 
It comes alive... 
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive...
It comes alive... 
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
....Takes me

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
..Takes me away!

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
....Takes me away!

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, Why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away




Purify

Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old Paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I

Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash
Ghost White
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes
Diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine

Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify (x3)

I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything

I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I ain't dancing with what might have been

Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?
Purify, you and I
Purify, you and I
Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?

You and I, Purify
You and I, Purify
C'mon, Purify!

Of Wolf And Man

1, 2, 1 2 3 4..
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I've been
Move swift - all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of...life

Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I've been
Move swift - all senses clean baby!
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of...life 
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
woah!

Got any wolves out there?? WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I feel a change
Back to a better day - shape shift
Hair stands on the back of my neck - shape shift
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I have been
Move swift - all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
Back to the meaning...of wolf and man, oh yeah!!

Hero of the Day

Mama they try and break me
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they go
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying? yeah
Mama they try and break me
Still they try and break me

'Scuse me while I tender how I feel (Thanks to Goob548)
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking starts wheels of dismay!

Don't want your hate 
But the fist I make 
For you, oh no fear
No not on me
So please excuse me while I tell them how I feel, ahh!

But now the dreams end (But now the dreams end)
And now the dreams end
They everlast the night
So build a wall 
Behind it crawl (so build a wall)
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?
I can't hear you!

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams end
And now the dreams end (But now the dreams end)
They everlast the night
So build a wall 
Behind it crawl (So build a wall)
And hide until it's light
Can't you hear your babies crying now?

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on how they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they are right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill men we kill, why? They do not know
Suffered wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from this pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on, I want it!
(crowd: For whom the bell tolls )
Absolutely!

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud, mother fucker!!
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
wooah Time marches on, give it to me!
(crowd: For whom the bell tolls)
You betcha!

Only knowledge will I save
To this game you stay a slave

Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah

Off the beaten path I reign

ONE

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much to real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I lived

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this shit out from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me
Please God wake me!

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me, help me!!

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell 
no, NO, NO NO NO NO NO!!! 






ENTER SANDMAN

Let loose man!
Say your prayers little one

Till the sandman he comes

Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light

Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war dreams of lies
Dreams of dragon's fire
And the things that with bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light, come on!
(crowd: Enter night)
Take my hand
We're off to never never land, hooo yeah!!!

Put your hands together!!

Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, and in your head

Exit light, come on!

FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE


Do unto others as they have done unto you 
But what in the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness 
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest 


chorus: 

Fight fire with fire 
Ending is near 
Fight fire with fire 
Bursting with fear 
We shall die 


Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast 
Armageddon is here, like said in the past 
chorus: 
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death 
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath 


chorus: 

 



FADE TO BLACK


Life it seems, will fade away 
Drifting further every day 
Getting lost within myself 
Nothing matters no one else 
I have lost the will to live 
Simply nothing more to give 
There is nothing more for me 
Need the end to set me free 


Things are not what they used to be 
Missing one inside of me 
Deathly lost, this can't be real 
Cannot stand this hell I feel 
Emptiness is filing me 
To the point of agony 
Growing darkness taking dawn 
I was me, but now He's gone 
No one but me can save myself, but it to late 
Now I can't think, think why I should even try 
Yesterday seems as though it never existed 
Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye 

 



TRAPPED UNDER ICE


I don't know how to live trough this hell 
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell 
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core 
Break the ice, I can't take anymore 


Freezing 
Can't move at all 
Screaming 
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 


Crystallized, as I lay here and rest 
Eyes of glass stare directly at death 
From deep sleep I have broken away 
No one knows, no one hears what I say 


Freezing 
Can't move at all
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 


Scream from my soul 
Fate, mystified 
Hell, forever more 
No release from my cryonic state 
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free 
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me 


Freezing 
Can't move at all
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under the ice 

 



ESCAPE


Fell no pain, but my life ain't easy 
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger 
I'll fight until the end 
To escape from the true false world 
Undamaged destiny 
Can't get caught in the endless circle 
Ring of stupidity 


Out of my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see 
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 


Rape my mind and destroy my feelings 
Don't tell my what to do 
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side 
And I can see through you 
Feed my brain with your so called standards 
Who says that I ain't right 
Break away from your common fashion 
See through your blurry sight 


Out of my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 


See they try to bring the hammer down 
No damn chains can hold me to the ground 
Life is for my own to live my own way 

 



CREEPING DEATH

Slaves 
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh 
Heed 
To his every word, live in fear 
Faith 
Of the unknown one, the deliverer 
Wait 
Something must be done, four hundred years 


So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 


Now 
Let my people go, land of goshen 
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire 
Blood 
Running red and strong, down the nile
Plague 
Darkness three days long, hail to fire 


So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 


Die by my hand 
I creep across the land
Killing first born man 
Die by my hand 
I creep across the land
Killing first born man 


I
Rule the midnight air the destroyer 
Born 
I shall soon be there, deadly mass 
I 
Creep the steps and flood final darkness 
Blood 
Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass 


So let it be written 
So let it be done 
I'm sent here by the chosen one 
So let it be written 
So let it be done 
To kill the first born pharaoh son 
I'm creeping death 

 



RIDE THE LIGHTNING


Guilty as charged 
But damn it, it ain't right 
There is someone else controlling me 
Death in the air 
Strapped in the electric chair 
This can't be happening to me 
Who made you God to say 
"I'll take your life from you!" 


chorus: 

Flash before my eyes 
Now it's time to die 
Burning in my brain 
I can feel the flames 


Wait for the sign 
To flick the switch of death 
It's the beginning of the end 
Sweat, chilling cold 
As I watch death unfold 
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear 
What I am doing here? 


chorus: 

Someone help me 
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away 
I don't want to die 
Time moving slowly 
The minutes seem like hours 
The final curtain call I see 
How true is this? 
Just get it over with 
If this is true, just let it be 
Wakened by the horrid cream 
Freed from the frightening dream 


chorus: 

 



FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS


Make his fight on the hill in the early day 
Constant chill deep inside 
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey 
On the fight, for they are right, yes, by who's to say? 
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know 
Suffered wounds test there their pride 
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know 


For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whom the bell tolls


Take a look to the sky just before you die 
It is the last time you will 
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky 
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry 
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery 
He hears the silence so loud 
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be 
Now the will see what will be, blinded eyes to see 


For whom the bell tolls 
Time marches on 
For whom the bell tolls

The Memory Remains

Fortune

Mirror vain

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave

Hide and swallow mansions whole
In light of an already
Faded prima donna

Gone insane

Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets

Dust to dust
Fade to black

The Unforgiven II

The door is locked now

If you can understand the me

Black hearts scarring darkness still

And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me

Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be

Better than you

Lock horns

Somehow I feel more alive
Bury the name for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be

Keep you clean or stained through

So wake up sleepy one

Low Man's Lyric

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let go
The net below has right away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
No one's safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
What is dawning to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'cause low man is due
Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for flame
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touched the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
No one's safe from the storm
I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
yeah
What is dawning to do
yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

So I cry
to the alley way
Confess all to the rain
But I lie
lie straight to the mirror
One I've broken
to match my face

The trash fire is warm

Nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bare to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
yeah
What is done and to do
yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

Solo
the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forget me
o
you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins



Fixxxer

Yeah
Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins in, make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble
But tell me
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in the mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
Yeah
Mirror, mirror upon the wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in a mother's son
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in the mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me
Jab it
Blood for face
Sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse
A ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun
Pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith
Which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again
So tell me
Can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in the mother's son
Can you heal the broken worlds within
Can you strip away so we may start again
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin in me
Oh yeah
No more pins in me, yeah
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no

To make the tree survive
Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once

And you brought your motor to me

Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end ya know it feels too slow
I'm giving you my room service
And ya know it's more than enough
Oh one more time ya know i'm in love

NO LEAF CLOVER


And it feels right this time
On this crash course we're in the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy....


Says it feels right this time
Turn around, found new high lights
Good day to be alive Sir
Good day to be alive, he said.....


Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just the freight train coming your way


Don't it feel right like this
All the pieces fall to his wish
Suck up for that quick reward boy
Suck up for that quick reward they said.....


Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
is just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel

FUEL FOR FIRE (Fuel demo)


This is a pre-release demo type thing of Fuel called `Fuel for Fire`, it sounds just like fuel, but the vocal track has been replaced with some older lyrics. This includes completely different verses from the final version. This version is available on some of the Fuel singles

Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!
Turn on the dynamo, into the wild I go,
No other place I know, I know.
Turn on I see red,
Warhorse, Warhead,
Throttle up for speed ahead, yeah ahead.


CHORUS:
Ooooh, on I burn,
Fuel these pumping engines,
Burning hard, loose and clean,
And on I burn, turning my direction,
Quench my thirst with gasoline.


Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,
Can't fight the need for speed,
I'm loose, I'm clean, I'm burning lean and mean, and mean.
Ignite the open trail,
Excite, exhale, comin' on, hot from hell, yeah hot from hell.


CHORUS


Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,
Oooh, yeah-heh.

SOLO1
On I burn!
SOLO2

On, and on, and on..
Give me fuel,

My desire,

Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!

BATTERY (Hetfield Ulrich)


Lashing out the action
returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power
crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Crushing all deceivers
mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker
feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Circle of destruction
hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury
dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery




MASTER OF PUPPETS 
(Hetfield Ulrich Burton Hammett)

End of passion play
crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me
you can't see a thing
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Needlework the way
never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly
ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me
you can't see a thing
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Master
master
where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master
master
you promised only lies
Laughter
laughter
all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter
laughter
laughing at my cries

Hell is worth all that
natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze
drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me
you can't see a thing
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name
'cause I'll hear you scream
Master

THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE (Hetfield Ulrich Hammett)

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father
roaming free

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos
underground
Cult has summoned
twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city
living death

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell





WELCOME HOME (Sanitarium) (Hetfield Ulrich Hammett)

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full
never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors
no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage

Sanitarium
leave me be
Sanitarium
just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied
it makes him well
He's getting better
can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen
damn it
we will win
They see it right
they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium
leave me be
Sanitarium
just leave me alone
Sanitarium
just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill
it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again






DISPOSABLE HEROES (Hetfield Ulrich Hammett)


Bodies fill the fields I see
hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now
no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields
bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall

Soldier boy
made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one
only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill
not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say
when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say
you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blindman

Barking of machinegun fire
does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks
get used to it somehow
More a man
more stripes you bare
glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends

Soldier boy
made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one
only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill
not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say
when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say
you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blindman

Why
am I dying?
Kill
have no fear
Lie
live off lying
Hell
hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth
nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself
molded day by day
Looking back I realize
nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy
made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty one
only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill
not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
greetings death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say
when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say
you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blindman

Back to the front




LEPER MESSIAH (Hetfield Ulrich)

Spineless from the start
sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
you play the lead clown
Please
please
Spreading his disease
living by his story
Knees
knees
Falling to your knees
suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust
time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money
send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah

Marvel at his tricks
need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
rotting your brain
Chain
chain
Join the endless chain
taken by his glamour
Fame
fame
Infection is the game
stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust
time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money
send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah

Witchery
weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap
hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust
time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money
send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat

Lie




DAMAGE INC. (Hetfield Ulrich Burton Hammett)

Instrumental

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees
conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred
our bodies work as one
Bloody
but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

Slamming through
don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it
but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh
you scream and shout
All flee
with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from

Damage Incorporated

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this
it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated





UNTIL IT SLEEP


(Hetfield , Ulrich)

Where do I take this pain of mine
I run, but it stays right my side


So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me, until it sleeps


Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once, and now it stays


So tear me open, but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, until I'm clean


*It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me


Until it sleeps**


So tell me why you've choosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed


I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps


*--** Repeat


I don't want it


So tear me open, but beware
The things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, 'till I'm clean...


I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the fear still shapes me 
So hold me, until it sleeps...


Until it sleeps...

 


MAMA SAID


(Hetfield, Ulrich)

Mama she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it fore it's done
The brigtest flame burns quickest
Is what I heard they say
A son's heart's owned to mot
her But I must find my way


*Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let your heart go
Or let this heart be still


Rebel my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done


* Repeat


**Never I ask you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still


Mama now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, Help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see


* Repeat


Let my heart go
Mama let me heart go
You never let me heart go
So let this heart be still


** Repeat

 


THE HOUSE JACK BUILT


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

*Opens door so i walk inside
Close my eyes
Find my place to hide
And i shake as I take it in
Let the show begin


Open my eyes
Just to have them close again
Well on my way
But on my way where I've been


It swallows me
As it takes me in it's fog
I twist away
As I give this world the nod


*Repeat


Open my eyes
Just to have them close once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again


Is that the moon
Or just the light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there?
Or just another demon that i meet?


**The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built


**Repeat


Open door so I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin


*Repeat x 2


Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there?
I twist away
Away
Away
Away

 

HERO OF THE DAY


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

Mama they try and break me


The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone


They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way


Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do ya feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?


Mama they try and break me
Still they try and break me


'Scuze me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real


Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair


Don't want your aid
But the first I've make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel


*But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind the crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies cryin' now?


Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do ya feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?


* Repeat


Mama they try and break me

 

BLEEDING ME


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

*I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to something 
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better


**I'm pushin' my stay
I'm pushin' my stay to something
I'm pushin' my stay to something better


I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted


This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted


It tears me and I bleed


***Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me 
I'm bleeding me I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me


*** Repeat


I am the beast that feeds the beast
I am the blood, I am the release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught under


*** Repeat


* Repeat


** Repeat 

 

CURE


(Hetfield, Ulrich) 

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek, no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again


He thinks the answer is cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man take another bullet
He's been fooled again


*Uncross your arms and take
And throw them to the cure, say...
I do believe
Uncross your arms now
Take 'em to it, say...
I do believe


The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again


* Repeat


Betting on the cure
Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Yeah everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure


I do believe


Betting on the cure
Yeah, it must be better than this
Need to feel secure
Yeah, it's gonna better than this
It must be better than this
Betting on the cure


Yeah, everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure


I do believe 

 

AIN'T MY BITCH


(Hetfield, Ulrich)

Outta my way, outta my day
Outta your mind and into mine
Into no one, into no one 
Into your step but outta time


Head strong, what's wrong?
I've already heard this song
Before... you arrived
But now it's timev To kiss your ass good-bye


*Draggin me down, why you around?
So useless
It ain't my fall, it ain't my call!
It ain't my bitch 


Down on the sun, down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell ya been
Damn it all down, damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again


Stand tall, can't fall
Never even bend at all
Before... you arrived
But now it's time
To kiss your ass good-bye


* Repeat


No way but down, why you around?
No foolin'
It ain't my smile, it ain't my style
It ain't my bitch


Ain't mine, your kind

Your steppin outta time


Draggin me down, why you around?
No foolin'

WASTING MY HATE


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

*Good day, how do
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you


Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself
Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time ya pleased yourself


* Repeat


Think you're worthy now
Think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two pronged crown


I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind goin' now?


* Repeat


Ain't gonna waste mt hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
(It's) better to give than to receive


Ain't gonna waste my hate
No, no ain't got time to waste my hate on you
Yea, I think I'm gonna keep it all for myself


* Repeat


Hate 

 

RONNIE


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

Story starts, quiet town
Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way


Then streets of red, red I'm afraid
No confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But oh my god, how that all did change
Now they all pray
Blood stains wash away


*He said "lost my way"
This bloody day
Lost my way
I heard him, he said "lost my way"
This bloody day
Lost my way
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today


I always said, somethin' wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smile
Talked alone, miles and miles


Gallow calls, son I say
Keep your smile, and laugh all day
Think once again, in this boring place
For little boys, how the soon change


Now they all pray
Blood stains wash away


* Repeat


Yeah, well all the green things die
When Ronnie go to the place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why
I'm cursed to wear this name"


Now we all know why children called him
Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket
They'd all fall down


*Repeat

 

THE OUTLAW TORN


(Hetfield, Ulrich,) 

And now I wait my whole lifetime
For You
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For You


I ride the dirt, I ride the tide
For you
I search the outside, search inside
For you


To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so i may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime


Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn


So on I wait my whole lifetime
For You
So on I wait my whole lifetime
For You


The more I search, the more my need
For you
The more I bless, the more I bleed
For you


You make me smash teh clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime


Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn


*Hear me
And if close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
remind me of what left this outlaw torn

 

THE THORN WITHIN


(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) 

Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within
And when I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame


*I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within


Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within
So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow me
One and the same are we


* Repeat


I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty
For us all


So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we


* Repeat

KING NOTHING
(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)

Wish I may
Wish i might
Have this wish tonight
Are you satisfied?


Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?


All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased


*And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around


**Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle crumbled
And you've left with just a name


Where's your crown?
King nothing***


Hard and cold
Bought and sold
A heart hard as gold
Are you satisfied


Wish I may
Wish I might
You wish your life away
Are you pacified


All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased


*--*** Repeat


I wish I may 
I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight


I want the star
I want it now
I want it all and i don't care how


Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish
You may regret it


Careful what you wish
You just might get it


Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around




HIT THE LIGHTS (Hetfield Ulrich)

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming its right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

You know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain oh sweet pain
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights






THE FOUR HORSEMEN (Hetfield Ulrich Mustaine)

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Time
Has taken its toll on you

The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die





MOTORBREATH (Hetfield)

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean

Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine

Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away






JUMP IN THE FIRE (Hetfield Ulrich Mustaine)

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
To join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire


 



(ANESTHESIA)-PULLING TEETH

Bass instrumental

Whiplash (Hetfield Ulrich)

Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show
We do our best you're the rest
You make it real you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It is hot as hell tonight

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here on the stage the marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kick your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We are gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we choose

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through the metal is gone
It is time to hit the road
Another town another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we will never stop
We will never quit
Cause we are Metallica

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash








PHANTOM LORD (Hetfield Ulrich Mustaine)

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the phantom lord

Fall to your knees
And bow to the phantom lord






NO REMORSE (Hetfield Ulrich)

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath
No remorse no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day another death
Another sorrow another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you
Know death is near
No remorse






SEEK & DESTROY (Hetfield Ulrich)

THE WAIT


(Original: Killing Joke) 
Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.


The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.


After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.


The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.


The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait. 


 



CRASH COURSE IN BRAIN SURGERY


(Original: Budgie) 
Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.


Raven black is on my track,
He shows me how to neutralize the knife.
Show to me in surgery,
The art of fighting words to conquer life,
conquer life yeah.


Now the wicked lance of fear,
Is driving from my heady mountain brain.
Crash course in brain surgery,
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again 
yeah, yeah, yeah. 


 



HELPLESS


(Original: Diamond Head)

I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight.
Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight.


See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.


Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.


I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight.
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love.
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above.


See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.


Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.


I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.


Cannot squeeze the life from me.


I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.


Cannot squeeze the life from me. 


 



THE SMALL HOURS


(Original: Holocaust) 
Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.


And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.


Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.


And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.


Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.


And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day. 


 



LAST CARESS / GREEN HELL


(Original: Misfits) 
I got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.
I got something to say, I raped your mother today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread.


Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath,
Cold sweet death, one last caress.


Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath,
Cold sweet death, one last caress.


I got something to say, I killed your baby today and it
Doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead.


Ooh lovely dead, just waiting for your breath,
Cold sweet death, one last caress.

Here in this place lies the key to your death,
Touch it, see it.
Here in this place is the means to your end,
Touch it, feel it, green hell.


You did your best as someone could,
I bet you never knew you would,
And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.


We're gonna burn in hell - Green hell.
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell, green hell.
Try let me get back up there - Green hell, green hell.
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell, greem hell.
Throw your fuckin' friends inside - Green hell, green hell.
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay - Green hell.
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell, green hell.
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell, green hell.
Gotta burn it all, green hell.

And did you run away from me,

Touch it, feel it, green hell.

And did you run away from me,
I bet you thought you really could.
You've come to this as someone told,
I bet you never knew you would.
Gonna bring green hell, green hell.


 



AM I EVIL?


(Original: Diamond Head) 
My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.


Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.


As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.


Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.


On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.


I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.


My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.


Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.


Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah. 


 



BREADFAN


(Original: Budgie) 
Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,
Gotta make a mint, gotta make me a million.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.


Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner,
With the man with all the filthy money.
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record,
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy.
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.


Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch,

Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.

Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be. 


 



THE PRINCE


(Original: Diamond Head) 
Now I see his face, I see his smile.
Such a lonely place, no golden mile.
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart.
His deeds through ages past tell of his part.


See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh.


Angel from below, change my dreams.
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem.
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn.
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns.


See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, o-oh, no-oh.


I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way.
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay.
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry.
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die.


See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no.

STONE COLD CRAZY


(Original: Queen) 
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumours going round, gotta clear out of town,
Smell like a dry fishbone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.


Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,
And she's playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.


Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded Tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me,
Gotta fucking get up and run.
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah. 


 



KILLING TIME


(Original: Sweet Savage) 
Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of the heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.


Preparations are made for the journey back,
It's a survival, supplies are packed.
No more nights in this eternal hell,
Destination is simple, we move out.


Killing time - You left from the line
. Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.


And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.


The silence is over, they attack again,
Killing and hatred drive me insane.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.


Killing time - You left from the line
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.


Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.


And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.


Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

(Originally recorded by Motorhead)
Huh

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late

(Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979)
Get on! 

You think you see me
In the glass
You think you hear me

Is your guilt and greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

You're a financial wizard
Yeah a top tycoon
You're Sweet long lizard

Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?

Your face has turned to hey
What ever happened to your life?

DAMAGE CASE


(Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979)
Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by his face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I Ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

Got no time for a damage case

No time baby!

Hey babe don't turn away

OVERKILL


(Kilmister, Clarke, Taylor)
(Originally recorded by Motorhead in 1979) 
Only way to feel the noise

So good I can't believe it
Screamin' with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill

Shut up

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead

Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill

TURN THE PAGE


(Bob Seger)

On a long and lonely highway east of omaha
you can listen to the engine, moanin out as one long song
you can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before


and your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
when you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
you don't feel much like travelin', you just wish the trip was through


CHORUS:
but here I am, on the road again
here I am, up on the stage
here I go, playing the star again
there I go, turn the page


you walk into a restaraunt, strung out from the road
and you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
you pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
sometimes you can here 'em talk, other times you can't


all the same 'ole cliches: is that a woman or a man?
and you always seem outnumbered, you dare not make a stand


CHORUS:


out there in the spotlight, your a million miles away
every ounce of energy, you try to give away
and the sweat pours from your body, like the music that you play
later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
echos of the amplifiers, ringin' in your head
as you smoke the days last cigarette, remembering what she said 


 



LOVERMAN


There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
It is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls
There's a devil waiting outside your door
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
There's a devil waiting outside your door

Loverman! Since the world began
Forever, Amen Till end of time Take off that
dress I'm coming down I'm your loverman
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am

L is for LOVE, baby
O is for ONLY you that I do
V is for loving VIRTUALLY all that you are
E is for loving almost EVERYTHING that you do
R is for RAPE me
M is for MURDER me
A is for ANSWERING all of my prayers
N is for KNOWING your loverman's going to
be the answer to all of yours

Loverman! Till the bitter end
While empires burn down Forever and ever
and ever and ever Amen I'm your loverman
So help me, baby So help me
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
I'll be your loverman!

There's a devil crawling along your floor
There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There's a devil crawling along your floor
And he's old and he's stupid and
he's hungry and he's sore
And he's lame and he's blind
and he's dirty and he's poor
ive him more
There's a devil crawling along your floor

Loverman! Here I stand Forever, Amen
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
Forgive me, baby My hands are tied
And I got no choice No, I got no choice at all

I'll say it again
L is for LOVE, baby
O is for O yes I do
V is for VIRTUE, so I ain't gonna hurt you
E is for EVEN if you want me to
R is for RENDER unto me, baby
M is for that which is MINE
A is for ANY old how, darling
N is for ANY old time

I'll be your loverman! I got a masterplan
To take off your dress And be your man
Seize the throne Seize the mantle
Seize the crown Cause I am what I am
What I am what I am I'm your loverman!

There's a devil lying by your side
You might think he's asleep
but look at his eyes
He wants you, baby, to be his bride
There's a devil lying by your side

Loverman! Loverman! 


 



ASTRONOMY


Clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand's become a crust
Most of you have gone away

Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door to let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Or the light that never
Never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

Astronomy...a star 


 



SABBRA CADABRA


I feel so good, I feel so fine
I love my little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away

Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me, love me every single day!

I feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
It feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, I'll love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universe of secret obtains
Destruction of the empty spaces
Here's my one and only prayer
I lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child never was concieved
You gotta believe me!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Well, I know it hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
When it's time to die
I don't believe the knife you have 
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, Ha Ha!!

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feel so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know she's all mine,
She's all mine, yeah! 


 



THE MORE I SEE


(Originally recorded by Discharge)

From where I stand I see
Pain suffering and misery

The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe

From where I stand I see
Hate violence and war

The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe


 



TUESDAY'S GONE


(Originally recorded by Lynyrd Skynyrd)

Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
I leave my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

And I don't know oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, I'll try again
I leave my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

Train roll on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

Train roll on, many miles from my home
See, I'm riding my blues away
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free
But somehow, I've got to carry on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind


 



WHISKEY IN THE JAR


(Originally recorded by Thin Lizzy)

As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money yeah I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman for you know she treat me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my money with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like ta hear, ta hear cannon ball a roarin'
Me I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chan yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Whiskey in the jar-o
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da 


 



MERCIFUL FATE


(All songs originally recorded by Mercyful Fate) 
Satan's Fall 
They're walking by the night 
The moon has frozen blue 
Long black coats a shelter for the rain 
Their load must get through 
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call 
Seven satanic Hell preachers 
Heading for the hall 
Bringing the blood of a newborn child 
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall 

Curse Of The Pharaohs 
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings 
Where the mummified pharaohs 
Pretend dead in their sleep 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly 
Just destroying your future 
Makin' it all shady 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 

A Corpse Without Soul 
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse 
I'm a corpse without soul 
Satan, he's taken, he's taken 
He's taken his toll 
And he took it on me 
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped 
I'm trapped in his spell 
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going 
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell 

Into The Coven 
Howl like a wolf 
And a witch will open the door 
Follow me and meet our high priestess 
Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 
Undress until you're naked 
And put on this white coat 
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring 
Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 

Evil 
I was born on the cemetery 
Under the sign of the moon 
Raised from my grave by the dead 
And I was made a mercenary 
In the legions of Hell 
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane 
You know my only pleasure 
Is to hear you cry 
I'd love to hear you cry 
I'd love to see you die 
And I'll be the first 
To watch your funeral 
And I'll be the last to leave 
I'd love to hear you cry 
And when you're down beyond the ground 
I'll dig up your body again 
And make love to shame 
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye 
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye 
You've gotta say goodbye 
'Cause I will eat your mind 


 



IT'S ELECTRIC


(Originally recorded by Diamond Head)

I'm gonna be a rock and roll star
Gotta groove from night to day
Gotta blow my crummy job
Gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna make a stand
Gonna make a million
Gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be wild my friend
I gotta push it through

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red and I leave on amber
And you face my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get the tilts from my hills
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric

I stop on red and I leave on amber
And you face my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get the tilts from my hills
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my route
Make it in a rock and roll show

It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric 


 



FREE SPEECH FOR THE DUMB


(Originally recorded by Discharge)

Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free fucking speech

Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free speech, free speech for the dumb
Free fucking speech 


 



BLITZKRIEG


(Original: Blitzkrieg) 

Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.


The day is coming, armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.


Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.


The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg. 




ENTER SANDMAN


Say your prayers little one
don't forget
my son
to include everyone
tuck you in
warm within
keep you free from sin
till the sandman he comes
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight
exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land

something's wrong
shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they aren't of snow white
dreams of war
dreams of liars
dreams of dragon's fire
and of things that will bite
sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight

exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land

now I lay me down to sleep
pray the lord my soul to keep
if I die before I wake
pray the lord my soul to take
hush little baby
don't say a word
and never mind that noise you heard
it's just the beast under your bed

in your closet
in your head

exit light
enter night
grain of sand
exit light
enter night
take my hand
we're off to never never land

 



SAD BUT TRUE


Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
'm your life
I'm the one who cares
they
they betray
I'm your only true friend now
they
they'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream
make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true
I'm your dream
mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
you know it's sad but true

you
you're my mask
you're my cover
my shelter
you
you're my mask
you're the one who's blamed

do
do my work
do my dirty work
scapegoat
do
do my deeds
for you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream
make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true
I'm your dream
mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away

I'm your truth
telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside open your eyes
I'm you
sad but true





HOLIER THAN THOU

No more!
the craps rolls out your mouth again
haven't changed
your brain is still gelatin
little whispers circle around your head
why don't you worry about yourself instead
who are you? where ya been? where ya from?
gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
you lie so much you believe yourself
judge not lest ye be judged yourself

holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
before you judge me take a look at you
can't you find something better to do
point the finger
slow to understand
arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
it's not who you are it's who you know
others lives are the basis of your own
burn your bridges build them back with wealth
judge not lest ye be judged yourself

holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not





THE UNFORGIVEN

New blood joins this earth
and quikly he's subdued
through constant pain disgrace
the young boy learns their rules
with time the child draws in
this whipping boy done wrong
deprived of all his thoughts
the young man struggles on and on he's known
a vow unto his own
that never from this day
his will they'll take away

what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never be
never see
won't see what might have been
what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never free
never me
so I dub thee unforgiven

they dedicate their lives
to running all of his
he tries to please them all
this bitter man he is
throughout his life the same
he's battled constantly
this fight he cannot win
a tired man they see no longer cares
the old man then prepares
to die regretfully
that old man here is me

what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never be
never see
won't see what might have been
what I've felt
what I've known
never shined through in what I've shown
never free
never me
so I dub the unforgiven

you labeled me
I'll label you
so I dub the unforgiven





WHEREVER I MAY ROAM

...and the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
so in her I do confide
and she keeps me satisfied
gives me all I need
...and with dust in throat I crave
only knowledge will I save
to the game you stay a slave

rover wanderer
nomad vagabond
call me what you will
but I'll take my time anywhere
free to speak my mind anywhere
and I'll redefine anywhere
anywhere I may roam

where I lay my head is home
...and the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
under wandering stars I've grown
by myself but not alone
I ask no one

...and my ties are severed clean
the less I have the more I gain
off the beaten path I reign
rover wanderer
nomad vagabond
call me what you will

but I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
and I'll never mind anywhere
anywhere I may roam
where I lay my head is home
but i'll take my time anywhere
free to speak my mind
and I'll take my find anywhere
anywhere I may roam
where I lay my head is home
carved upon my stone
my body lie
but still I roam
wherever I may roam





DON'T TREAD ON ME

Liberty or death
what we so proudly hail
once you provoke her
rattling of her tail
never begins it
never
but once engaged...
never surrenders
showing the fangs of rage
don't tread on me

so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
so be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...
don't tread on me


love it or live it
she with the deadly bite
quick is the blue tongue
forked as lighting strike
shining with brightness
always on surveillance
the eyes
they never close
emblem of vigilance
don't tread on me

so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
so be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

don't tread on me
so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
liberty or death
what we so proudly hail
once you provoke her
rattling on her tail

so be it
threaten no more
to secure peace is to prepare for war
so be it
settle the score
touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...
don't tread on me





THROUGH THE NEVER

All that is
was and will be
universe much too big to see
time and space never ending
disturbing thoughts
questions pending
limitations of human understanding
too quick to criticize
obligation to survive
we hunger to be alive

all that is
ever
ever was
will be ever
twisting
turning
through the never

in the dark
see past our eyes
pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
on a quest
meaning
reason
came to be
how it begun
all alone in the family of the sun
curiosity teasing everyone
on our home
third stone from the sun


all that is
ever
ever was
will be ever
twisting
turning
through the never
on through the never

we must go
on through the never
out of the
edge of forever
we must go
on through the never
then ever comes

all that is
ever
ever was
will be ever
who we are
ask forever
twisting
turning
through the never
never





NOTHING ELSE MATTERS

So close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters
never opened myself this way
life is ours
we live it our way
all these words I don't just say
and nothing else matters
trust I seek and I find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters

never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
but I know

so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters

never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
but I know


never opened myself this way
life is ours
we live it our way
all these words I don't just say
trust I seek and I find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters


never cared for what they say
never cared for games they play
never cared for what they do
never cared for what they know
and I know

so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
no nothing else matters





OF WOLF AND MAN

Off through the new day's mist I run
off from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
therefore I am
harvest the land
taking of the fallen lamb
off through the new day's mist I run
off from the new day's mist I have come
we shift
pulsing with the earth
company we keep
roaming the land while you sleep

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean
earth's gift back to the meaning of life
bright is the moon high in starlight
chill is the air cold as steel tonight
we shift
call of the wild
fear in your eyes
it's later than you realized

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean

earth's gift back to the meaning of life
I feel I change
back to a better day
hair stands on the back of my neck
in wildness is the preservation of the world
so seek the wolf in thyself

shape shift nose to the wind
shape shift feeling I've been
move swift all senses clean
earth's gift
back to the meaning of wolf and man





THE GOD THAT FAILED


Pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
not the word
not the love
not what you thought from above

it feeds
it grows
it clouds all that you will know
deceit
deceive
decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
never your hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed
find your peace
find your say
find the smooth road in your way
trust you gave
a child to save
left you cold and him in grave

it feeds
it grows
it clouds all that you will know
deceit
deceive
decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed
I see faith in your eyes
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
follow the god that failed

pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
trust you gave
a child to save
left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
broken is the promise
betrayal
the healing hand held back by deepened nail
follow the god that failed





MY FRIEND OF MISERY


You just stood there screaming
fearing no one was listening to you
they say the empty can rattles the most
the sound of your voice must soothe you
hearing only what you want to hear
and knowing only what you've heard
you you're smothered in tragedy
you're out to save the world

misery
you insist that the weight of the world
should be on your shoulders
misery
there's much more to life than what you see
my friend of misery

you still stood there screaming
no one caring about these words you tell
my friend before your voice is gone
one man's fun is another's hell
these times are sent to try men's souls
but something's wrong with all you see
you you'll take it on all yourself
remember
misery loves company

misery
you insist that the weight of the world
should be on your shoulders
misery
there's much more to life than what you see
my friend of misery
you just stood there creaming
my friend of misery





THE STRUGGLE WITHIN

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real
kicking at a dead horse pleases you
no way of showing your gratitude
so many things you don't want to do
what is it? what have you got to lose
what the hell
what is you think you're gonna find?
hypocrite
boredom sets into the boring mind

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within
home is not a home it becomes a hell
turning it into your prison cell
advantages are taken
not handed out
while you struggle inside your hell
reaching out
grabbing for something to u've got to feel
closing in
the pressure upon you is so real

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within

reaching out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real
what the hell
what is you think you're gonna find
hypocrite
boredom sets into the boring mind

struggle within it suits you fine
struggle within your ruin
struggle within you seal your own coffin
struggle within the struggling within .

Do You See What I See?

Do You Feel What I Feel? 
Bittering Distress 
Who Decides What You Express 
Do You Take What I Take? 
Endurance Is the Word 
Moving Back Instead of Forward Seems to Me Absurd 


Doesn't Matter What You See? 
Or into it What You Read 
You Can Do it Your Own Way 
If It's Done Just How I Say 


Independence Limited 
Freedom of Choice 
Choice Is Mad for You My Friend 
Freedom of Speech 
Speech Is Words That They Will Bend 
Freedom with Their Exception 


Do You Fear What I Fear? 
Living Properly 
Truths to You Are Lies to Me 
Do You Choose What I Choose? 
More Alternives 
Energy Derives from Both the plus and Negative 
Do You Need What I Need? 
Boundaries Overthrown 
Look Inside to Each His Own 
Do You Trust What I Trust? 
Me, Myself and I 
Penetrate the Smoke Screen I See Through the Selfishlie 

Doesn't Matter What You See 
Or into it What You Read 
You Can Do it Your Own Way 
If It's Done Just How I Say 

Independence Limited 
Freedom of Choice 
Choice Is Mad for You My Friend 
Freedom of Speech 
Speech Is Words That They Will Bend 
Freedom with Their Exception 

Do You Know What I Know? 
Your Money End Your Wealth 
Your Silence Just to Hear Your Self
Do You Want What I Want? 
Desire Not a Thing 
I Hunger after Independence Lengthen Freedom's Ring 


Doesn't Matter What You See 
Or into it What You Read 
You Can Do it Your Own Way 
If It's Done Just How I Say 


Independence Limited 
Freedom of Choice 
Choice Is Mad for You My Friend 
Freedom of Speech 
Speech Is Words That They Will Bend 
Freedom no longer frees you 


Doesn't Matter What You See 
Or into it What You Read 
You Can Do it Your Own Way 
If It's Done Just How I Say 





ONE (Hetfield,Ulrich) 

I Can't Remember Anything 
Can't Tell If this Is True or Dream 
Deep down Inside I Feel to Scream 
this Terrible Silence Stops Me 
Now That the War Is Through with Me
I'm Waking up I Can Not See 
That There Is Not Much Left of Me
Nothing Is Real but Pain Now 


Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death 
Oh Please God,wake Me 


Back in the Womb its Much Too Real 
in Pumps Life That I must Feel 
but Can't Look Forward to Reveal 
Look to the Time When I'll Live 
Fed Through the Tube That Sticks in Me 
Just like a Wartime Novelty 
Tied to Machines That Make Me Be
Cut this Life off from Me 


Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death 
Oh Please God,wake Me 


Now the World Is Gone I'm Just One 
Oh God,help Me Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death 
Oh Please God Help Me 


Darkness 

Imprisoning Me 
All That I See 
Absolute Horror 
I Cannot Live 
I Cannot Die 
Trapped in Myself
Body My Holding Cell 


Landmine 


Has Taken My Sight 
Taken My Speech 
Taken My Hearing 
Taken My Arms 
Taken My Legs 
Taken My Soul 
Left Me with Life in Hell





THE SHORTEST STRAW (Hetfield,Ulrich)

Suspicion Is Your Name 
Your Honesty to Blame 
Put Dignity to Shame 
Dishonor 
Witchhunt Modern Day 
Determining Decay

The Accusations Fly 
Discrimination, Why? 
Your Inner Self to Die 
Intruding 
Doubt Sunk Itself in You 
It's Teeth and Talons Through

A Mass Hysteria 
A Megalomania 
Reveal Dementia

The Fallaout Has Begun 
Oppresive Damage Done 
Your Many Turned to None 
To Nothing 
You're Reaching Your Nadir 
Your Will Has Disappeared 
The Lie Is Crystal Clear 
Defending 
Channels Red 
One Word Said 
Blaclisted 
With Vertigo Make You Dead 

Shortest Straw 
Chalenge Liberty 
Downed by Law 
Live in Infamy

HARVESTER OF SORROW (Hetfield/Ulrich)

My Life Suffocates 
Planting Seeds of Hate 
I've Loved, Turned to Hate 
Trapped Far Beyond My Fate 
I Give 
You Take 
This Life That I Forsake 
Been Cheated of My Youth 
You Turned this Lie to Truth 


Anger 
Misery 
You'll Suffer unto Me 


Harvester of Sorrow 
Language of the Mad 
Harvester of Sorrow 


Pure Black Looking Clear 
My Work Is Done Soon Here 
Try Getting Back to Me 
Get Back Which Used to Be 
Drink up 
Shoot in 
Let the Beatings Begin 
Distributor of Pain 
Your Loss Becomes My Gain 


Anger 
Misery 
You'll Suffer unto Me 


Harvester of Sorrow 
Language of the Mad 
Harvester of Sorrow 


All Have Said Their Prayers 
Invade Their Nightmares 
See into My Eyes 
You'll Find Where Murder Lies 

Infanticide 

Harvester of Sorrow 
Language of the Mad 
Harvester of Sorrow 
Language of the Mad 
Harvester of Sorrow





THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY (Hetfield,Ulrich,Hammett) 

Never Hunger 
Never Prosper
I Have Fallen Prey to Failure 
Struggle Within 
Triggered Again 
Now the Candle Burns at Both Ends 
Twisting under Schizophrenia 
Falling Deep into Dementia 


Old Habits Reappear 
Fighting the Fear of Fear 
Growing Conspiracy 
Everyone's after Me 
Frayed Ends of Sanity 
Hear Them Calling 
Hear Them Calling Me 


Birth of Terror 
Death of Much More
I'm the Slave of Fear,my Captor 
Never Warnings 
Spreading its Wings
As I Wait for the Horror She Brings 
Loss of Interest,question,wonder 
Waves of Fear They Pull Me under 


Old Habits Reappear 
Fighting the Fear of Fear 
Growing Conspiracy 
Everyone's after Me 
Frayed Ends of Sanity 
Hear Them Calling 
Hear Them Calling Me 


Into Run 
I Am Sinking 
Hostage of this Nameless Feeling 
Hell Is Set Free 
Flooded I'll Be 
Feel the Undertow Inside Me 
Height,hell,time,haste,terror,tension 
Life,death,want,waste,mass Depression 


Old Habbits Reappear 
Fighting the Fear of Fear
Growing Conspiracy 
Myself Is after Me 
Frayed Ends of Sanity 
Hear Them Calling 
Frayed Ends of Sanity 
Hear Them Calling 
Hear Them Calling Me





TO LIVE IS TO DIE (Hetfield,Ulrich,Burton) 

When a Man Lies He Murders 
Some Part of the World 
These Are the Pale Deaths Which 
Men Miscall Their Lives 
All this I Cannot Bear 
to Witness Any Longer 
Cannot the Kingdom of Salvation 
Take Me Home 





DYERS EVE (Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammet) 

Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
What Is this Hell You Have Put Me Through 
Believer 
Deceiver 
Day in Day out Live My Life Through You 
Pushed onto Me What's Wrong or Right 
Hidden from this Thing That They Call Life 
Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
Every Thought I'd Think You'd Disapprove 
Curator 
Dictator 
Always Cencoring My Every Move 
Children Are Seen Bur Are Not Heard 
Tear out Everything Inspired 


Innocence 
Torn from Me Without Your Shelter 
Barred Reality 
I'm Living Blindly 


Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
Time Has Frozen Still What's Left to Be 
Hear Nothing 
Say Nothing 
Cannot Face the Fact I Think for Me 
No Guarantee,it's Life as Is 
But Damn You for Not Giving Me My Chance 
Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
You've Clipped My Wings Before I Learned to Fly 
Unspoiled 
Unspoken 
I've Outgrown That Fucking Lullaby 
Same Thing I've Always Heard from You 
Do as I Say Not as I Do 


Innocence 
Torn from Me Without Your Shelter 
Barred Reality 
I'm Living Blindly 
I'm in Hell Without You
Cannot Cope Without You Two 
Shocked at the World That I See 
Innocent Victim Please Rescue Me 


Dear Mother 
Dear Father 
Hidden in Your World You've Made for Me 
I'm Seething 
I'm Bleeding 
Ripping Wounds in Me That Never Heal 
Undying Spite I Feel for You 
Living out this Hell You Always Knew.
