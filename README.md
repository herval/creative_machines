Creative Machines
=================

A bunch of small studies on [content generation machines](https://speakerdeck.com/herval/creating-creative-machines-v0).

The focus right now is on simple content generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (CharRNNs) and Markov Chains. 

I'm updating this project sporadically, as new ideas (and the time to implement them) show up.

# Subprojects

## [Dictiowat](dictiowat/README.md)
A study on generating dictionary entries for invented words.

## [Markovian Literature](markovian-writer/README.md)
Generating book samples based on text extracted from Project Gutenberb books using [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). All content tweeted under [@markovian_lit](https://twitter.com/markovian_lit)

## [Unforgiven Swift](unforgiven-swift/README.md)
A Neural Network that generates random music lyrics crossing the genius writing of Taylor Swift and Metallica. The Unforgiven Swift also automatically posts its creations on [Tumblr](http://unforgiven-swift.tumblr.com/)

## [Haikuzao](haikuzao/README.md)
A Neural Network that generates unlimited Haiku on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/haikuzao).


# TO DO

- Run the bots as a Unikernel
- AWS-runnable training (to allow using GPU instances for faster training)
