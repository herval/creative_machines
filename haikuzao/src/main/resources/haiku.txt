a skein of birds
twines across the sky
the northbound train departs

dawn chorus begins
I reach for
the snooze button

en haut des cuisses
dans l'espace sous le slip
un morceau de mer

new March snow
the grouse with a missing toe
still around

Remembrance Day-
even the traffic
pauses for 2 minutes

21-gun salute-
mortar fire echoes
in his eyes

dignified march-
veterans and peacekeepers
pass the applause

morning commute-
headlights fade
in the whiteout

homebound ferry
thoughts zigzagging
with the terns

yellow walnut leaves
slowly appear on the lawn
early morning light

the mulberry
one brief smell of cut wood
in two hours work

the tang of hot tar
carried on a breeze 
summer's end

summer clouds 
not enough paint to hide
the graffiti

rabbit and the hawk -
an awful truth stains
the fresh snow red

quick mid-winter thaw
each icicle drips
at its own pace

medicine wheels
cairns of field stone appear
in the cold spring fog

shoots of green grain-
old abandoned houses
stand along the highway

dirtballs, dust and clay
a drilling rig's relentless motion

through autumn's dusk
the computer wanes and hums
one hundred crows

autumn deepens
we gather the few
remaining seeds

an aroma
of green walnuts
summer dusk

100 degree heat
country-western music
from the asian bar

reaching
for a new found warmth
sweet rhubarb cake 

she's found the gate
in the wall of willows
sunlight of spring

distant voices
a thin crust of ice
lingers on snow

solo trip
in the campfire smoke
old memories

long ago
I threw your letters away
footprints in snow

afraid of a boy
with an old man's eyes
needles of frost

the best lies
have the fewest details
cold half-moon

dull in a crescent's light
a canoe rests on the roof
autumn flood

a few leaves remain
at the ends of the branch
a brittle moon

sunflower
the day passing
slowly

August moon
countless raindrops to measure
the length of the day

moon phase
the welfare check
comes on the fifth

rose petals
fallen on bare earth
evening rain

raindrops
my sister's voice
from half a continent
away

morning fog
the bluebird's call
clearly audible

the wasp
trapped between panes of glass
first spring light

a hazy moon
floats in my cup
white sake

temperature rising
thunderstorms and traffic noise
through the north window

homeless
pushing a cart along
Commerce Avenue

a line of coal cars 
viewed from the railroad bridge 
returning chill

icicles melting
another drunk pisses
in my alley

taking a bite
from a bitter orange
january thaw

christmas night
the little corner store
last to close

evening thunder
a homeless man
comforts his dog

city sunrise
these old buildings
cast long shadows

night shift
in the parking lot car lights
dim near morning

what day is this?
the metronome gathers dust
in the corner

4th of July
hotter than
a firecracker 

no work today
a carpenter ant wanders
aimlessly

garage sale
customers discuss
philosophy 

garage sale
'tales of power'
for half price

taiko drummers
listening to silence
between the beats

no moon, no stars,
just dull light from the city
summer haze

lost
on wildwood road
water lilies directionless

suddenly
the toads go quiet
rain begins

long dry grass
bristles underfoot
iced tea

rabbit trail
nothing but ears
above the snow

firecrackers
far off in the distance
pepper on my tongue

between the drone
of lawnmowers
a scent of rain

returning chill
dissonate melodies
from the ice cream truck

waiting for the moon
before departing
ducks on the roof

galette
person-to crown me
even for one night

Gold medal
on the back of the jewel
my sweat

full moon
so bright and round
the station clock

sudden downpour -
crying and then laughter teen
Employment quest

muddy grave -
the rich scent of roses
so red

full moon -
the bride tells me
it was forced

lingering cold...
the last jar of maple syrup
on the cupboard shelf

fridge magnet -
snack after snack
wasting away

advanced Parkinsonism
she wipes his dribbling saliva
remembers his kisses

half-moon
first day of the sales
in Oxford Street

unwanted memories
more present than the past

gale force wind
dandelion seeds
in ocean depth

old barn 
the swallows' nests
long abandonned

Eid's sale
the Sikh shopkeeper
opens later than usual

si ronde la lune
cette fin de Juillet cesarienne
pour la patronne du Green Cafe

wild Foehn
another murder
goes unsolved

mango flavoured tea
in a silver tin - departing guests
linger a while

a dry new year
december snowman begins
to show his age

alphabet soup -
my best haiku ever
...... digested

oh moon, moon
above so much powdery snow
father is still ill

a McDo box
floats towards the fountain
insect on board

lune des neiges
si froide encore
notre entente

first snow
the asylum seeker
thoughts on the land

moon rain
even longer day
so dark yet

checking Dividends
cashpoint on the screen
to and fro... an ant

long barge
slow on the canal
the moon

almost lost
among the shifting hues
of dusk
the faint calligraphy
of swans

crocus breeze -
my dying mother's words
come back to me 

august wind
on the dock seagulls
stand on two legs

sudden downpour -
the memory of a butterfly
washed away

the corridor
was long and dark...
news of your death
closer
with each step

from one year
to another -
the same moon

day moon -
the distance between us
full of silence

A rippled moon :
In the pond, 
A sinking stone.

Lighting the room,
candle by candle
a winter evening.

my umbrella
flipped in the windâ€“
uncertain days

masons at work
creeping along the stone wall
afternoon fog

death of a friend
more leaves
turning brown

white sheets on the line
slow-motion clouds
in the summer sky

georgia peach
sweet cream and wrinkle remover
in the shopping cart

wild roses
the iron trellis
tilts to one side

spring dawn
with the returning geese
my mind takes flight

clothes dried on the line-
a spring morning
still in the folds

the old town
even now the rough stones
soak up the warmth

early morning walk
reaching through the mist
for wild berries

a walk to the beach
the asphalt road changes
to sand

morning mist-
we follow the scent
of slow moving cows

bird song
pulling me out of a dream
first day of spring

haiku group
the discussion stops
for a robin

bus stop-
the winter dance
of cold feet

buttocks after another
it precedes me
Gare Saint-Lazare

sea breeze 
under full sail
a pregnant skipper

fresh snow
beginning the new year
with a clean slate

party over
the snap crackle of logs
in an empty room

tea in china cups
the wet afternoon perfumed
with tangerine peels

the heat wave broken
morning coffee sweetened
with a cool breeze

cold sunshine
the stray orange cat
tucked into itself

sleety rain
flowered umbrellas
sold out

summer reading
the dot of an i
moves down the page

drifting
from somewhere
pear blossoms

a curve in the road
looking for lilacs
in the wind

the rain over
even with eyes shut
I know it's spring

road closed
moose tracks continue on
local traffic only

gray and cold-
a hothouse bouquet
for his widow

incoming fog
a forgotten memory
comes in flashes

from an open barn
the odor of hay and manure
and climbing roses

plot, plop on the road?
cars follow the cow trail
to the milking barn

moon gazing
fogging up the cold window
with my breath

snowy afternoon
a slow accumulation
of desire

stacking stones
for a garden wall
the weight of their age

bouquets of lilacs
the last bunch fills
a milk bottle

twilight rain
the scent of lilacs
through the window

dead heading lilacs
the fragrance lingers
in memory

strong winter wind
bits of Batman kite wings
fall from the tree

April warmth-
a new crop of dandelions
since yesterday

an ant in my bed-
for the two of us
not enough room

Hurricane Irene
in the semi-darkness
a cold breakfast

heavy time
slowly ticking the minutes
Hurricane Irene

Fourth of July
watching fireflies
on the lawn

between morning chores
I open the door-
lilacs in the rain

the neighbor's lilacs-
gathering the fragrance
to myself

all day long
the rhythmic beat
of melting ice

blank date book-
the gray afternoon
turns to white

sleet and rain-
stirring extra sugar
into hot mush

in the orchard
rotten apples now crunchy
winter solstice

tree trimming
we listen to the music
of soft rain

early autumn
the sound of falling water
is cold

at the lawn concert
lighting one spot at a time-
fireflies

cricket in the house-
if only we shared
the same bedtime

the Thanksgiving meal -
after eating the talk
slows down

black-out
the holiday glow
of fireflies

black-out
in my neighbor's house
a room to room glow

in the back alley
school-kids puffing away
in the shadow of a chimney

riverside promenade 
seniors stroll through
falling leaves

a koi rises
to meet a falling leaf -
autumn afternoon

strong wind
back and forth on lake ice
streetlight reflections

Empty eyes
gaze at a poppy field...
journey's end.

a layer of ice
forms on the red sleigh
february rains

high tide
feeling the moon's pull
in the waves

january freeze
koi chase each other
above the television

groundhog day...
sharing a sausage
with friends

autumn seabreeze...
a film of salt forms
on his glasses

grey morning...
a whale on the beach lies
shrouded in fog

beyond blossoms
under the cherry tree...
white snow cover

new widescreen tv:
watching junk in
high definition

winter day's end... 
a bowl of brown rice miso, 
warm in the hands

homework 
after the school bus passes
a spider rebuilds

december warm spell
the neighborhood snowmen
are all plastic

frosty meadow 
another dawn
reaches across

between sips... 
reading a book 
about sake

her piano-playing 
comes to an end... 
sounds of autumn hail

first snowfall
the dog's legs
have become shorter

first snowfall...
here is a christmas card
to be mailed, last year

at a desk,
i write
this ku

a bluejay takes flight
the neighbour's car
needs washing

grey sky
a monarch butterfly
lost in autumn

after the guests leave
the lilies
open

sultry afternoon
only the mailbox shadow
crosses the dirt road

old pond
after the frog
the stillness

frost
on the spent firework casing
new year's day

winter park -
white wings and blue lights
flashing

photo archive
the ice skaters' grins
frozen in time

a wasp
struggling in the web
last apples

clematis climbing
climbing through
the climbing rose

fifteen elephants -
after the storm
the cockerels waking 

anti social behaviour -
all night the wind
kicks a can around

day long weeding
the last dandelion
under my bench 

lazy rain
the solitary blackbird's
dawn chorus

black hole
near beaver dam a whirlpool spins
autumn leaves vanish

last light
on the allotment
the glow of a fag dimp

crushed shell
in the morning light
the snail's last movements

elevator
an ex's scent
hanging

returning from night shift
my neighbour
and his cat

the old barn wall
with every missing brick
a swallows nest

frosty morning
the steam rising from roofs
and my African coffee

recycled
with each bottle
the same resolution

morning mizzle
the screech of a gull
far from the sea 

tinted windows -
through the gap
his fingers wriggle thanks

approaching storm
even the gate
has lost its squeak 

long journey back home 
a forgotten bale of hay
slowly rots away

April 2nd
the snow
still lying 

two dog walkers
meet -
two conversations

the broken panes
of the old greenhouse -
still the new shoots

school fair
on the fireman's helmet
a faint smell of smoke

frozen dawn
the runner recovering
in his own steam 

morning rush hour
at the side of the road
wild damsons

Caruso recording -
the gramophone crackle
lights the fires in his eye

the police car slows -
suburban foxes
looting from bins

restless -
across the summer night
siren upon siren

still the spent firework's
cordite smell -
nest of serpents

balmy evening
the stillness of sheets
on the line

the name
I didn't want to see -
bitter coffee

airborne again -
the roadkill's
feathers 

road trip
at the end of the argument
a patch of blue

the heather still in bloom -
we take Mum the long way
back to the hospice

chuntering at something
the blackbird on the fence post
- election day

weaving its way
through the rush hour traffic
a white butterfly

bringing only
silence
the storm cloud's weight

roadside memorial -
the faded plastic windmills
still racing

two minutes silence
the shifting light
of a windy day

hunter's moon 
the end of the path
darker

 

strong April wind
the smell of Iowa hogs
in Minnesota

earthquake night
Tokyoites walking home
the long Friday

back to my hometown
blooming with a sweet scent
mom's oriental lilies

jizo bon
akora mo sodachi
furu chochin

thunder rolling
thinking of my daughter
at the campsite

frozen blueberries
in a bowl of yogurt
by the fireside

hi wo abete
tsuyu konu uchini
akaki yuri

traffic jam
melting snow runs
on the windshield

a sunny day
pink haze of the cherry blossoms
over the hill

amefuri no
  minoru kaki yori
     hito shizuku

the old temple
a snake on the stone step
crawling away

afternoon escape
within the prison walls
a library

new year bon fire

typhoon warning
a farmer on the path
between the rice fields

March wind
a strawberry off
from my birthday cake

the farmer lady
a few daffodils in a basket
of white radish

a new year's bonfire
misty rain
on the embers

scent of lilies
orange pollen
on my white sweater

crisp morning air
a bird left his feather
at my window

muggy night
a lizard on the window screen
- motionless

summer night breeze
each wish
on bamboo branches

rain clouds
fragrance of
sweet basil

Christmas dinner
grandma's fruit cake attracts
only blue jays

cracking walnut
there might be
another universe

around where the
steppingstone ends off
autumn gone

from an old temple
to an old temple
autumn wind

hundreds of
gentians blooming
class reunion

typhoon passed
one watering can
in the sandbox

typhoon passed
comes the
local circus

red dragonflies
gather around the
blind person

after the storm
the wind chimes
realigning

riding down the escalator
the scent of snow
on damp coats

Day of the Oscars-
in the Spring sun
I plant onions...

spring evening
under a black umbrella
phone number and key

November clouds-
hearing of
my sister's illness...

april noon
out come the sun
and some slugs

street garden
again without leaves
faded graffiti

school bus
finally round the bend
lighting a cigarette

rubber boots
looking for the next
deeper puddle

rain clouds
basking in the light
of an Ikea lamp

louver ajar
as falls slowly
the rising sun

cold morning
far from coming clouds
and our mouths

Lime Water
memories to be smaller
and the greatest summers

zen garden
rain disappears
into pebbles

Afternoon rain
Scents rise
From the garden.

rivulets
on a foggy window
the cancer's spread

first Christmas
a tiny new stocking
joins the family

moonlight
baby's cheek
at breast

early spring
everything
dripping

quitting time
the smell of rain
in the lobby

waves
slowly cresting towards shore
a faint moon

rainy bridge-
the river flowing
faster

spring breeze-
the balcony's shadows
on my book

winter drizzle
all the passing faces look
into the cafe

dwindling bonfire
a shooting star
near Orion

A spring morning
The pond's surface blurred
By raindrops.

cold night-
a plane blinks through
Orion's bow

late night at the office
an exit sign floats
next to the moon

dark tree silhouettes
low on the horizon
Orion rises

Distant thunder
the smell of rain
before the storm.

Under the Magnolia
red seeds float away
November rain.

the boat crests a wave -
tracing my finger around
an ancient stone

urban geese -
voices extemporise
around a sitar

so cold -
a goose honks its way
across the night sky

sodium light -
a darker world beneath
the puddles

lockerbie -
the long walk from graveyard
into town

first date
not even noticing
the new moon

silbury hill -
my wife pregnant with our
first child

cold snap -
more than my prints
on the camera

summer haze-
a lone grey wolf pads south
along the highway

thrill of her flute -
twenty three years
of our lips touching

stilled by the stream -
delicate frost flowers
crunch under work boots

evening traffic -
caught in a low moon
the heron's flight

white sun ::
an inch of snow
on the lawnmower

harvest moon :
the bigger pumpkin
waits for a face

mill row ::
every door
a different color

harsh snow ::
a corpse
at the dam

coffee cold
she clips the obituary
from many papers

election day ::
a butterfly about to settle
on the seesaw

new moon ::
my sister's voice
after all this time

steam billows
from the cooling tower ::
sunrise

morning mist
a canada goose
asleep on the dock

painting
the dark side of the house
solstice

midnight
the changing wind
in the silver maples

silent phone
only the ring
from his teacup

her fresh flowers -
his fresh grave
valentine's day

valentines -
the mailman's steps
break the ice

rush hour 
closing the car window
on my hair

ancient stone circle
the flow
of a robin's song

rainy Baltimore
umbrella blossoms
in cafe windows

summer solstice
he remembers
to lift the sea

fresh paint
a white moth circles
the bug light

first snow fall - 
covered with maple leaves
at sunrise

first light
broken blue shell
under the maple

All Saints Day -
in the field only small
pumpkins are left

December dusk -
a solitary pine tree
all lit up

We talk in the street,
surrounded by melting snow
and mad rushing crowd

a vagabond on the bench
covered with a nude girl
on the newspaper

just before dawn
the bright moon
of the computer screen

her skin
pale in the moonlight
ebb tide

autumn chill -
the silence
of the bee hive

cloudy skies -
different shades of shadow
in the cauliflower

tai chi
slicing the morning mist
in quarters

the therapist says nothing
I haven't told myself -
rainless clouds

late night at the airport
the shoe shine man
polishes his own shoes

Buenos Aires tango
at the end of an alley
the Big Dipper

hot summer day
a bowl of picked berries
without sugar

beach house -
unlocking the gate
to the ocean

in and out
of the haiku lesson -
the fragrance of the lilies

open window
the moon's reflection
in the toilet bowl

Seafood tank,
Lobsters move slowly,
Far from Maine.

behind net curtains
her face glides from window
to window

jogging at dusk
around the neighborhood
the smell of garlic

Dead robin  
its breast still
burning red.

Not so good
for all the fish
Good Friday

St. Patrick's Day
in front of the pub
yellow pouring out of the daffodils

At rest
in the crow's nest
crescent moon

In Morse code
the woodpecker
announces spring

On the Ferris wheel
reaching up
to stroke the moon 

to the headstone
old footsteps frozen
in old snow

Japanese New Year
how small the new moon
in its halo

covered by snow
like the other stones
little Buddha

Awake 
Smell of rain

et blanc de brouillard
et ces croix de bois 

sugar for the tea
behind the bowl
a line of ants

fire ant mound
against the flower pot
after the rain

we talk about
our disappointments

new bookshelves
the poetry my cat finds
in an empty box

croissant crumbs
I try and find
the right words

summer rainstorm
the balloon man
sells umbrellas

sunset
the fisherman's silhouette
edged with light

three sneezes
all that's left
of the snowman

the cat shifts
from sunspot to sunspot
Sunday morning

sound of the rain -
penetrating my sleep
at dawn

making soup
my hands could be
my mother's hands

awake too early
trees shrouded in mist
the slow tick of a clock

the damp stain on the wall
only looks like a damp stain -
Monday morning

sunset over the sea
I remember when my mother
ran faster than me

again this year
the wind-sown poppies
flower between stones

thanksgiving
my mind wanders
to my dead brother 

crescent moon
just enough light
for this path

warm rain on the pond
my thoughts rise
with the koi

the red maple-
striptease
in the driveway

sunny afternoon
  an old man lingers
near the mailbox

police watch the crowds
at children's carnival
the horse's teeth

mountain stream
   two well placed rocks
the path home

winter clouds
seem to move slower too
in the cold night

it happened
just after the full moon
snow

in the dry grass
frost appears
on the fallen pears

autumn breakfast
the last mosquito's hover
over my campfire

evening flares
at summer's end
fireflies

summer's end-
a cool rain slides
down the hollyhocks

summer's end
my hand lingers
in the dry grass

dandelion seeds
  ai r  b  o   r   n
     in a cool breeze

Shivering
in the cold spring air.
  Plum blossoms!

the rumble of thunder
louder

along the road
shape of a willow
conforms to the trucks

a child's face
smiles from the page

from last nights rain
reflects the clouds

Fog on the mountain,
Rain tapping the window pane,
Cup of tea, steaming.

rehashing last night

tasting
the freckle on her cleavage
with my eyes

rummage sale 
her husband in the chair
not worth keeping

she finally swats the fly

next to the new calendar
a clean slate

train whistle...
palm prints linger
against the glass

my parent's ashes, together
in the moonlight

an ancient path
in a sky without time
departing geese

her Sunday dress
the color of bruises
merging

Saturday night
the sound of weeping
seeps from the wall

before dinner...
the spider and a fly
share the sunset

he kissed me
on the fourth of july
fireworks!

old tepu Avenue
- Rain in May

two ladies of a certain age
speak bra
- Train May

sun's rise
the voices of crows
lift it higher

her round ass
amount escalator
half Moon

fringed white lake
February 1
to Metz

taken in the Moselle
a bottle
the ass in the air

in the truck's headlights
women's legs
who will enter the building

black with blue flowers
slip violist
- Shostakovitch

buttocks in buttocks
upstairs
Austerlitz station

End of november -
basting few worries
still blooming

red panties
cellist -
concert in Luzon

only his shoe
left crisse
after Mass

Low squared
on the beautiful legs woman
- Sudoku?

sun's rise
the voices of crows
Lift It Higher

when the sun
illuminates the window of the bus,
this mosquito is excited

barely half
the right moon
clear November sky

on the pavement
the leaves are agitated
soon the full moon

passing in Caroline Street
with my four artichokes
- Runny nose

dormant
next to the orange fish -
full moon of November

the edge of her panties
on his nice little buttocks
berthed

a book in tent
on his chest
- Wind and wave

at the corner of Avenue
every morning at 9: 30 pm
he closes his tent

small concert cars
the morning
to get going

the top of the tree
tickles the nose
Giant Buddha

Canada Day
this country and I
aging together

dustpan and broom
the paper hearts
square of the town hall

The shadow
his chin piercing
twelve o'clock mark

blue eyes
she drinks water source -
eve of summer

two o'clock in the morning
a tiny insect
through the new page

Of laughter
fall through the window
- Saturday night

dancing fabric
around the woman's legs
transport strike

Rumors am -
the shadow of a smoke
on the white facade

great Tide
oil
at the highest

At the foot of the lamppost
a fir January

Full moon night -
the shape of the models' breasts
in the shop-window

ocean playground
the way memories come and go
with the tide

late into the night
our two empty cups
since a long time

middle of August
haikus
at low tide

the poetess
part, remain the haiku
and the cold cup

breasts mannequins
link in the window
- Approach of spring

on the chimney
blue roofer
- Vernal Equinox

New York September
the one-way sign Points Towards
the billowing cloud

perfectly round moon
Condensation on the glass

Without world news
One hundred butterflies fly in the grass
this morning

Garden gates
closed
on river water

blackout 
how bright Mars shines
this summer night!

endless winter
more soft snow as we await
a new grandchild

skyscraper
a window-washer squeegees
the thunderhead

insomnia
the mouse)
has it too

afternoon rain-
a neighbor opening her curtains
too

a famished mallard
has emigrated
to the city zoo

bark beetles
in the Ponderosa pine
these gnawing doubts

rush hour -
one leaf's journey
to the ground

autumn trail
the smell of something wild
lingers

forest silence...
the cool green glow of lichen
wet with sunlit steam

old village...
mosquitos enough
for everyone

sweeping leaves...
her lovesong interupted
by a sigh

seed catalogues
in the mail daily
morning snow fluries

under snow
the same earth
waiting waiting

dusk breeze
another birthday spent
viewing others

bamboo flute
mournful notes flying
to an absent moon

still smiling
water beads and drips
off Buddha's nose

suzukaze ya
ubune no nobori
mijikayoru

seed catalog
the colours of
a winter daydream

constellations
of quiet raindrops
sleepless night

cabin walls 
feeling my way through
a wilderness night

against my skin
the roughness of firewood
hoar frost

twilight
a cricket's 
sudden silence

just west of dawn
an earful of geese
heading south

tulips buried - 
the soft silence
of April snow

the grey sound
of a boat's emptiness
cold dawn rain

on the morning side
of the river's end
rising star

puddles of sky
a child's first step
in the clouds

moving day
my shadow by the pond
one last time

growth rings
a child sings her way
around a tree

my missing pen
the cat pretends sleep
on a winter's eve

unknowns
waiting for the wind
to cry again

sunday eve
the blues moan softly
across the pond

storm clouds
billowing in the wind
a stranger's coat

deep canyon
the grand voice
of a tiny wren

from Hiroshima
to Sendai...
so much just gone

desert night
a constellation of tents
glows yellow

smoke on the wind
midnight's every breath
tastes of fire

grey autumn day
knowing when it's time
in my bones

where trees bloom
with egrets at dusk
the quiet sky

at the deep end
of a winter day
birdsong

just extinguished-
smoke slowly curls
out pumpkin eyes

autumn equinox
opinions
turning

waiting by the door
the sun
rising

shortest day
her countdown to christmas
quickens

between train tracks
recumbent beer bottles
beset by frost

snowstorm
too many flakes
for haiku

the line of poplars
blackens a mackerel sky...
February blues

following me
downriver to work:
the pastel moon 

sharp night
a thin plume of smoke
from the fire station

crow after crow
the morning darkens
with biblical rain

honking through the darkness
long before their shapes:
the twilight geese

winter solstice
the street sweeper picks up
a glass half full

at either end
of the twelve-carriage platform:
spring mist

street of cafes:
cherry blossom gusts
across the tables 

hail on the train-
a young woman's leg
straddles her boyfriend's

almost spring
outside the embassy
plaque polishing

lengthening days
I turn the Christmas lights
off

for seconds between
flood rains: the sunny colours
of market mangoes

like scattering tacks:
the forecast record rainfall
on the bus's roof 

yellow moon
a glimpse of a porpoise
easing upstream 

the river streaks pell-mell
on either side of Eel Pie Island
two pied wagtails 

at Hampton Court
the river rises
to medieval levels...
the slow-motion beats
of a swan into flight

the forecast rain...
a queue-jumper gets berated
by everyone

late again-
the lights change
in the evening puddle

shortest day
three geezers paint
the pub's front green

steam train...
just over the wall
a winter-flowering cherry

through steamed-up windows the park fill of mist

perseid shower
the intake of her breath...
another contraction

American night
... the technicians
jostle

Din el ru
the little morning
ene Homeobox preserved
heckling

Drizzle
- On the ground
crushed,
a worm.

Brussels-Munich -
Fly Racing
on the PC screen

at the foot of the bank -
dandelions
flowering

TV debate -
her breasts flopped
in the bodice

Against the light -
off a large dog
freely

Snail shells
empty -
first shoots

new year -
the same street this morning
silence and more

blonde wig - a small smile after chemo

my grandfather's sword...
the impenetrable Silence
of falling snow

the dead tree
in the lush forest -
covered with votive

intermission -
we talk about war
behind the scenes

fall this morning -
the bird on his left shoulder
coated

Rainy day
Through windows
The yellow jasmine

arthritis -
another glass of wine
the left hand

commotion
in the computer's belly -
I'm hungry

gray dust
on the marble fireplace -
and your picture

the deaf
with his glasses -
black

After the dispute -
the plates are still
dirty

Little sun -
through the windows
dirty

dull afternoon...
-even the fresh snow
is tinted gray

Jam
on the birthday card -
signed Baby

sudden hail
the argument breaks off
mid-sentence

sudden hail
she tells me to be careful
what I wish for

distant thunder
I dream I've forgotten
where my parents live

first frost
the squirrel plants acorns
where we buried the cat

fall equinox
a black squirrel running
on the power line

mudslide
the last rain of 2005
segues into '06

Hiroshima Day
a 13 kiloton
sunset

autumn leaves
the harvest moon
fades

winter sun
the flat of my hand
on the cold window

Late winter snow
a distant whistle Train
cuts through my silent

view of the bitter
when she looks out the window
with that vague air

the words under the fingers
the blind and Braille Book
friction paper

watching
the lunar eclipse
a dead rose

pilgrim counts
every second step
stone in shoe

trinitarian glasses
help both speaker and listeners
to see more clearly

Canada Day we play
another concert
in the rain

winter rain -
the man's face
of snow

gray buds
glycine - today
it would have sixteen

ashen moon
He asked him
the divorce

on the line
his gray ball
the suburban

Cigale earthenware
and walker -
end of the journey

heavy snowfall
a hawk on a fence post
almost white

winter depression the colour of rain in the river

waiting for you
the changeful rhythm 
of the rain

airport gate 
the undetected poison
of your words

spring changes...
I clean rust off the latch
of an old desire

mountain rain -
the beetle and i
scurry for cover

raindrops plop
into my coffee cup
summer rain 

spring in the air -
the stone path to the mailbox
well polished

autumn light - 
in the silent glades
me and the gun...

late fall -
the scent of rain
in your hair

parting...
the clatter of train tracks
into dark

fading bougainvillea
 in the night sky...
    mars!

splatting drops...
  moments ago they held
      a rainbow

after the long wait...
  two unattended dove eggs
      in summer rain

from the armoire,
scent of passion in a candle
yet to be burned

mid October
the sudden thinness
of my robe

wood flute music
through an open window
the crow's rasp

cold May moon... the long road stretches out of sight

mothers' day
I let the phone ring longer
for her

scenting two pages
of the Webster's Unabridged...
wild lilac

Valentine's dinner
nothing on the menu
suits him

stroke of ...
his snoring punctuated
by fireworks

stillness...
a few flat stones
beneath the pine

purple irises
stand still
rain or shine

lunch at the cove
the ebb and flow
of their conversation

distant thoughts-
the last ember
cools

more wine?
he places an afghan
around my shoulders

computer drone
overtaken by the sound
of pounding rain

cold May moon...
the long road stretches
out of sight 

deeper into autumn
she aches for an honest touch

heat storm
a quick breath between flash
and crashing thunder

in the mirror
a much older woman
returns my glance

April shower -
last drop
of green tea

Morning fog -
only the scent of
eucalyptus

rain all day stacks of old magazines closer to the door

church ruins
the grace
of a butterfly

pleasantly drunk
in the orchard
a flock of waxwings

Memorial Day
a layer of dust
covers his urn

hawk's hover -
the view of calm seas
through a gunport

overcast night
maybe the stars burn brightly
over Gaza

at the memorial
a hawk's cry
scatters her ashes

forty-six years
writing my name
yellow in snow

glimmer of revival
at the window
full moon

sunny terrace
forget Christmas
oncoming

on the gray tarmac
in the rain back
yellow bus

does not make his bed
undo the
day return

watching seagulls
search the market remains
imagine the sea

at the other end of the world
on the train window
Race raindrops

under the endless rain
the gray spot
the colors of the arena

with my dad
speak to learn to grow old
- The smell of clematis

Chat of joggers...
the heron and I
motionless

March night
listen to the rain
crashing on the tiles

subway platform
the beggar snores
his bottle stands

in the middle of the night
the hum of the ventilation
between two sirens blaring

first day of autumn
the sun hits the tile
one last time

Lost in the hubbub
on the opposite platform
the shouting match

anonymous signature
old pigeon footprints
the bare cement

Monday in October
in and out of the subway
without seeing the day

Metro Morning
this urine odor
tenacious

red tasks first
on the hillside
sun on my cheek

heavy sleep
after plum alcohol
collected in his garden

breathing deeply...
that smell of woodyards
in the rain

I saw the horizon
in the subway
in four by three

the sound of rain
drown the echo of my footsteps
autumn morning

from room to room
the mouse moves
without worrying about us

iced or hot tea
I hesitate
last day of August

it is no longer
cold tap water
heat wave

sitting on the ground
her bare shoulder
armless

three cardboard pieces
scattered
remains monte

a snail adventure
the still hot asphalt
June storms

sad sandwich
fell from a machine
soulless

the only lights on
in a passive fight
against the darkness of the whole building

new snow
I Almost forget
our quarrel

shirtless window
I read haikus
summer rain

just for a moment
the smell of pine trees
way to work

early in the morning
looking at fog
partner after the wedding
early morning
watching the fog
after marriage

more than the shining sun
in the morning
I want her

nothing more tiring
than Being tired of sleeping alone
warm coffee

crushed mosquito
red line on the floor
subway in may

spring wind
on my neck
cooler than your breath

the coin
as cold as the machine
which to me made

Black jacket
under trees
with pink flowers

in the train
all the scents of the morning
overshadowed by the tramp asleep

the stone bullfrog
under the bird feeder
just sits

white
the pages of my notebooks
I do not like winter

nose in the air
fixing the invisible
bum perched

listen to the rain
next to my phone
quiet

at Rise
piss in the autumn wind
make a haiku

first flakes
think of my father
on his hospital bed

my cold bed
my skin looking hers
first flakes

stroking the cat
a cold drop
my neck

sad smile
the line of bum who sleeps
on the subway platform

her plastic lifelines
in harsh hospital light -
even fresh flowers, fade

five star hotel -
a cockroach scurries
pool-side

my pregnant daughter
watches
the stone bullfrog

his old hands
working the soil -
smell of brewed tea

on the clothesline
his and her shirts
side by side again

between the mist
and the edge of the forest
a white buffalo

harvest moon
rose garden
has lost its colors 

eerie moonlight
graveyard
of the rusted automobiles

indian summer
first light
finds the tallest tree

drought
no clouds
in the bird bath

tea party over
lipstick 
smiles remain

after the cloudburst
birdbath full
of sky again

underside
of the flower pot
one hundred legs

high tide
yesterday's footprints
gone

coffee season
singing
from the trees

no moisture
mother earths skin
has cracked

typing small i
only because morning coffee
occupies my other hand...

In the space-between
trees and mist
a white buffalo

drumming
heartbeat
in the mist

Mekong river
the swaying of our hammocks

bone dust
after cremation
the winter sky

behind the cafe
the sound of children
or crows 

rain scented air
a thousand frogs
croaking

black friday
dip-dyed desperation
gusting down the mall

snowmelt -
the garden blooms
with children's toys

customs' declaration -
only the memory
of eucalyptus

autumn gale
a month's mortgage payments
scatter the lawn 

Christmas Day
a present of rain
on the pony's back

november blossom 
a brightness to find
what might have been lost

deep autumn
there's wind enough to winnow
wild rice

shortening days...
the petals fall
into dust

leaver's day
a wind too strong
for butterflies

endless rain
christmas lights
bleed in a puddle

gibbous moon
the smell of woodsmoke fills
a wait for rain

cider farm
a sweetness
on the breeze

neon veil
a neighbour's lights
outshine the moon

customs' declaration -
determining the value
of new haiku

yew harvest
deep hues fill
a redwing's hunger

autumn gale
the sunflowers turn
their seedy cheeks

she's leaving home
a pair of shoes
that no longer fit

indian summer
it's what the sunflowers
waited for

glinting on
a retirement card
autumn rain

autumn mist
my neighbour asks me
what I do

straw truck delivery
someone else's summer
strewn down our lane

autumn rain
my socks dry on
the pc tower

autumn equinox
i let the last fly
go free

after rain
honeysuckle
awake again

bonfire's glow
my niece cups her hands
around a firefly

summit cairn
a raven's call
lost to the wind

pathless moor
the cackle of grouse
hidden by mist

New Year's Day
a deer hesitates
in the headlights

dentist's chair
counting dead flies
in the striplights

the morning after
oak leaves cradle
last night's hail

hung in a cobweb
between gorse flowers
christmas rain

perseid showers
only rain in
the night garden

summer longing
a dampness in the washing
left out overnight

night after night
the farm dog forgets
he knows me of old

last day of term
my daughter breaks
the uniform code

after the rain a winter street full of moons


softening
my new jacket
spring rain

spring wind
tachograph discs
turn down a backroad 

steam railway
blackthorn blossom
follows the tracks

all fool's day
behaving like
a teenager again

day after day
on the road to work
a single magpie

spring sunshine
the jogger's stride
a little longer

my daughter says
i resemble a drunk
winter rain

St David's Day
a mower cuts the green
green grass of home 

efficiency seminar
a reek of cheap fat
lingers in the hall

referendum day
a few pale shoots
after the frost

roadside tribute
last year's leaves
cover a fox

black run
a skier's cigarette
points downhill

commuter traffic
no light to stop
a starling flock 

february gale
the empty bird feeder
taps my office window

i arrange my tie
to hide a stain
misty hollow

supermarket sign
the melancholia magnified
by drizzle

february dawn
the rhubarb rises
a deeper red

afternoon fog
the point of the meeting
getting lost

a red cloud
on the horizon
robin's song

valentine's day
a patch of snow
the sun hasn't found

marsh wren's cry
the sun ripples onto the mud

we race dry leaves
down the road home
the north wind and me 

jumping ice cubes
all over the floor
... a hair in my whiskey

new freedom
blue dress now
a table cloth

blowing bubbles
my breath floats away
in different sizes

three feet distance
needed for reading my ku
without glasses

langs zijderoute
dansende rupsencocons
in kokend water

her garden bench
she was always sitting
butterfly on moss

a temple garden
snowy path to bronze bell
having deep footprints

wiping the full moon
from a wet glossy table
with my bare hand

flea market -
a sitting buddha
on his left side

northern lights
steam rises
from the coffee cup

Veterans' cemetery
a wide expanse of lawn
beyond the graves.

late summer
an inchworm
less than an inch

talk of dying
the mention of ranch land
I have never seen

spring morning
flies return
to a crab carcass

migrating swallows
she tells me
she'll pray for me

letter from overseas
a call from southward geese
penetrates the thicket

spring mist
the tree I take shelter under
planted in remembrance

first raindrops
the freight train I passed
two states ago

hard winter ground -
we argue about
the constellations

walking to work -
the blossoms on my street
late this year

the smell of water between the iron pump and cup

snow outside
a small bowl
of imported oranges

abandoned house 
children picking mangoes
in the yard

A pear
A worm's hole leaves
a bitter taste.

children dancing
circles in the rain-
autumn leaves

falling leaves-
unpacking winter clothes
from cedar trunks

summer heat
my air conditioner
sweating

summer's end-
one haiku becomes
another

Twin Towers-
where once two shadows
now only sun

rice seedlings-
each step deeper
in the mud

Fragrant spring blossom
children play outside until
there is no more light.

withered roses 
a bald woman waits 
for the taxi

Halloween night
ghosts and goblins
watch the rain

desert wind
the potter's fingerprints
on an ancient shard

together
we watch the eclipse
far apart

faded asters
the cortege pauses at her gate
moves on

biopsy
just a cyst - this time
a break in the clouds

plastic flowers
placed beside the highway
memory fades

dead cat...
open-mouthed
to the pouring rain

mud puddles
leaving behind
a high heel

waiting for the train
a huddled mass
of smartphones 

zazenâ€”
that fly battering itself
against the sunny window

dusk
the mason jar filled
with fireflies

morning meditation  
a steaming
manhole cover

winter rain 
the dog and I
exchange sighs

pure blue 
a broken
robin's egg

asleep at the wheel
the ghost cabbie
of my nightmares

gibbous moon 
she's not telling
the whole truth

two-hour meeting 
shadows creep
across the table

frost on the windshield 
I remember how much
I drank last night

budget cuts 
a crescent moon
on the horizon

Ash Wednesday 
a dusting
of snow

police sirens 
another night
without the moon

love letters -
i rake the embers
of the fire

crashing waves-
my thoughts move
with the tide

final approach -
she pencils in
her eyebrows

melting snow -
an unfinished
haiku

the Dow falls -
rose petals
in the wind

between doses
of cough medicine
silence

snow flurries -
my unborn grandchild's
perfect fingers

stuck behind
a schoolbus -
thunderclouds

crescent moon -
leaning her head
against my shoulder

icy conditions -
another slide
on Wall Street

converting to condos
the nightclub
where we met

in a dark place
quietly fermenting
homebrew

in the attic
the sound of march rain
so much louder

graffiti glistening in the flickering streetlight 

new moon -
time to lose
the beard

emptying the wine bottle -
another conversation
about Mom

my stock portfolio -
puddles filled
with winter rain

occupying Wall Street
the ghosts
of my retirement dreams

that recurring dream
in which I pull the fire alarm
and run

epiphany -
Jesus and Mary
stopped at the border

epiphany -
the gift of a dead mouse
at the door

not softened
by sepia tones
images of war

first thaw -
someone should have warned
the daffodils

hot day
the cool inside
an apple

snow turns to rain -
wondering when
it all went wrong

war -
fathers
burying sons

domestic terrorism 
winter moths
at the door

harvest moon 
grass gone to seed
on the tennis court

huddled smokers 
another conversation
about The Cloud

hazard lights
through raindrops
October leaves

cold stethoscope 
I lie to the doctor
about my drinking

starless night 
I can't believe
the weekend is over

after the rain
a puddle filled
with stars

abandoned school 
a soft breeze ripples
through the weeds

her small fingers
tightly grip the pencil
writing her new name

after the conference
pigeons feasting
on crumbs

still pond 
a dragonfly lands
on the moon

severe thunderstorm warning 
a murder
of crows 

daylight fades 
my mother asks
the same question twice

ghost town  
a rooster crows
for no reason at all

end of the road 
three big dogs
with nothing to do

an oasis
in the Bible Belt 
adult book store 

after the storm
the streets
have no names

early autumn 
the golden highlights
in her green hair

half moon 
something
I'm forgetting

house for sale
the dandelions allowed
to bloom

mixed precipitation 
a flat finish
on Wall Street

a long meeting 
permanent marker
on the erasble whiteboard

sipping absinthe
the impressionist painting
of night

urban incense 
a steaming
manhole cover

sailing the seas
of my subconscious 
her fishnet stockings

cold snap 
the junkyard dog's
heavy chain

wolf moon 
suddenly I see her
in a different light

laundry day 
the search
for matching socks

Christmas leftovers 
my mother forgets
why she called

the sudden chill
a fresh layer of ice
on the fire escape

looking for something
in the bottom of a cup
the low autumn sun

bad beer 
the stock market
goes flat

mixed precipitation 
she tells me I look good
for my age

enlightment 
a police car
on fire

Thanksgiving night 
an empty parking lot
at the nursing home

Thanksgiving rain 
the unblinking eyes
of a shelter dog

Thanksgiving rain 
the dog
no one wanted

alone at the bar
the missing letters
in a neon light

new moon 
the doctor schedules
a biopsy

morning fog 
an empty
tequila bottle

asleep
on the subway floor
the unknown soldier

a granita before
the afternoon shift
short shadows

Veteran's Day 
the old dog's
gray muzzle

Dia de los Muertos 
her elegant cheek bones

on a cold night
the hollow echo of your voice

tornado watch 
now available
in HD

under attic dust
another unopened envelope

my daughter's birthday 
a child's balloon
above the clouds

spring mist 
my granddaughter cries
in my arms

a sudden chill 
my credit card
declined

Patriot's Day 
a homeless veteran's
weathered sign

dusk 
that song
still makes me cry

two moons
somewhere between ports
she tells him it's over

Holy Week 
three bare trees
against a gray sky

morning mist 
the fragrance
of strong coffee

bitter wine 
time for that conversation
about Mom

the old oak tree
where we first kissed
marked with an "X"

new photos
of my granddaughter 
crocuses in bloom

twilight 
she tells me she has
a spare toothbrush

crescent moon 
the fullness
of her hips

still pond 
koi swim
through the sky

tempest in a teapot 
my mother
serves me decaf

equinox 
an 18-wheeler crossing
the double yellow line

lengthening shadows
things best said
in a letter

equinox 
splitting
the last of the wine

still wandering
the empty corridor 
cheap perfume

winter storm watch 
beware of falling
stock prices

empty terminal 
headline news
for ghosts

wolf moon 
the sway
of her hips

mid-winter thaw 
an unscratched
lottery ticket

crowded train 
a clash
of perfumes 

new moon  
forgetting
old acquaintances

the blank page
learning nothing
from the pine

abandoned playground 
the graffiti
fades 

piercing stones
all along the promenade
cicadas and ringtones

first date 
trying not to talk
to her cleavage

crescent moon 
the dog sleeps
with one eye open

dusting off
the Christmas lights 
gibbous moon

cold coffee 
the crunch of a Christmas ball
under foot

her lips
beckoning mine 
highway billboard

snow flurries 
my unborn granddaughter's
heartbeat

darkening skies 
the final hours
of the weekend 

the moon
and my wine glass
half full

town landfill 
old timers
arguing politics

stock market report 
a stalled car
in the intersection

camellia buds -
my wife begins
to cradle her belly

too hot to shop
wasps drinking from
a town fountain

Day of the Dead 
all the leftover
Halloween candy 

hunter's moon 
searching
for my keys

cold night 
I become
the dog's pillow

first snow 
an almost
perfect shave

fair-weather clouds 
an ultrasound
of my next grandchild

a true wonder of the world 
how she fills
her Grand Canyon t-shirt

my rising blood pressure -
a vapor trail
in the sky

hot city night 
the sizzle
of a broken sub-woofer

loosening
the top button of her blouse
with my eyes

snow turns to rain 
the afterglow
of the plow lights

our parting kiss
a mixture of salt
and sweet peppers

snow day 
more white than I remember
in my beard

footprints in the snow
words
I can't take back

New London winter 
the gleam of pleasure boats
wrapped in plastic

winter chill -
shredded plastic
in a barbed wire fence

lazy midtown morning -
another layer of paint
on the rusty fire escape 

lazy midtown morning -
do those green copper gargoyles
feel the cold? 

first of December -
the darkness
before dawn

first of December -
police tape clinging
to a burned-out barn

first of December -
another cold cup
of coffee

winter clouds -
my gray hair
grayer

October rain 
all through the night 
my kidney stone

December rain -
the long night
longer

a break in the clouds 
my third cup of coffee
grows cold

clear skies 
a solitary crow
on a high-voltage wire

November dusk 
do the streetlights know
how early it is?

November dusk 
the warmth
of a familiar song

overcast 
just one more game
of solitaire

more rain 
a mouse trapped
between walls

new moon 
an abandoned car
on lover's lane

new moon 
a missing
mouse trap 

new moon 
the mouse in the ceiling
awakens

the soldier looks
back over his shoulder
autumn grass

autumn equinox 
my baseball glove
right where I left it

sudden chill 
an empty bird feeder
outside the nursing home

waning moon 
a hand-printed sign reads:
"lost dog"

stifling heat 
our new neighbors'
argument

heat wave 
the dog moves slowly
from shadow to shadow

restless night 
a tree frog
in and out of tune 

morning haze 
one light rinse of the coffee cup
is good enough

Memorial Day 
stars obscured
by distant smoke

red dragonfly 
my newest granddaughter's
tiny fingers

June cold snap
the next-door neighbor's
house for sale

half-way home
a pint of stout
to keep out the cold

after the rain
a light on in the basement
of an empty house

finally Friday 
the dog so attentive
around the grill

cold April rain 
I no longer remember
your name

cold April rain 
my daughter's birthday
on another continent

cold April rain 
the sediment
at the bottom
of a wine glass

going out of business â€” 
the naked mannequinâ€™s 
Mardi Gras beads

caffeine buzz 
snow in the forecast
somewhere else

moonless night 
an ambulance speeds by
with its lights out

moonless night 
an empty can
of whipped cream

moonless night 
pulling the dog
from shadow to shadow

in from the cold
just one sugar cube more
in my coffee

too wired to sleep
too tired to dream
winter wind

crowded train 
her perfect lips
pierced

autumn rain 
the warmth of one too many
glasses of wine 

wolf moon 
the dog
wonâ€™t come in

blue moon 
I wonder where my children
are tonight?

bitter cold â€”
even the Christmas lights
seem to shiver

December rain â€”
a phone call
from my son

December rain â€”
a deer tail
and then nothing

April overcast 
my son turns twenty
in Iraq

March 
a broken umbrella
crosses the street

drawn in by the smell
of fast food and vinegar
this october sun 

deep winter 
a stray dog sniffs
an empty coffee cup

late train 
all the highlighted passages
in his bible

one week before Christmas
a three-legged dog
sniffs the trash

crowded train 
the drunk offers me his seat
for five dollars

the trainyard at dawn 
new graffiti
on an old caboose

equinox 
two limes
in my margarita

Veteran's Day 
a frightened dog
at the animal shelter

twilight 
I direct a stranger
to the wrong train

Valentine's Day 
awakened by a kiss
from the dog

burning leaves 
Kerry concedes
the election

first juice
a lone wasp explores
the apple press

rumors of war 
removing decorations
from the Christmas tree

troubled sleep 
steam rises
from a storm sewer

my daughter's 18th birthday 
the warming sunshine
in her hair

Wall Street watch 
the unnerving plunge
of her neckline

stood up
by a part-time lover 
shooting star

orthopedist's office 
all paintings tilted
slightly off center

afghan invasion 
the dog
on my side of the bed

approaching storm 
my twelve year-old's fascination
with war

Autumn colors 
the receptionist's
bright red hair

first frost 
I trim
my graying beard

first buttercup
three lines of coke
on the kitchen table

three shades too dark
the lipstick
on his collar

a familar name
on the victims list 
my coffee grows cold

between
silent construction cranes
the Milky Way

the end of summer 
my light beer
suddenly darker

my daughter starts college 
another empty
pint of beer

first day of vacation 
shooting star
on a moonless night

train running late
an ant climbs
the station wall

planning our trip
lightning flashes
beyond the horizon

distant thunder 
a shower of pollen
falls from the trees

the haze lifts 
she tosses her hair
over her shoulder

chrysanthamums
the homeless girl pulls
her baby closer

dangerous lightning 
she watches me
watching her

unhooking her bra
the moon peeks
over the treetops

my daughter's graduation
tightening the knot
on my necktie

crowded train station 
the tap tap thump
of a blind man's cane

mist turns to rain
our cat's last day

staring at me
from the bathroom mirror
an age spot

my son's twelfth birthday
a rabbit hops
across the busy street

sunny spring day
walking through a cloud
of perfume

the train arrives
one more sip
from an empty cup of coffee

wedding night
the parents of the bride
in separate beds

alba brumosa
funghi rossi crescono
fra le tombe

a second glass of wine -
the poem goes
unwritten

tube ride
someone else's iPod
is playing our tune

Spring snow 
an expecting mother rests
her hands on her belly

energy crisis 
long line
at the coffee shop

Ash Wednesday 
the priest
lights a cigarette

where dirty snow
meets road salt
a dozen roses

after so many thorns
a rare and perfect rose

snow mixes with rain 
my mother keeps calling me
by my brother's name

away on business 
the restless cat
on your side of the bed

lunch hour 
the automatic teller machine
eats my card

staring at her neckline
the deep plunge
of the NASDAQ

the NASDAQ falls 
moss clings
to a weathered tombstone

 too hot to sleep
i search for my son's footprint
in the front drive

troubled sleep 
somewhere in the darkness
an unlocked door

commuter daydream 
I follow the slit in her skirt
into oncoming trafic

her well-tanned shoulders
wrapped in a sweater 
the end of summer

asleep on the train
the gentle rise and fall
of her breasts

first date 
under the streetlight
our shadows hold hands

tent revival
the preacher's wife
in a miracle bra

Mass Pike trafic
the bright red glare
of her lipstick

reflecting
the graffiti landscape
Soho rain

my son's eleventh birthday 
miles of cold gray rain
between us

in the produce aisle
a voluptuous woman
compares melons

working late
the sound of a small brown moth
in the lampshade

market forecast:
record warmth
followed by rain

bitterly cold
a box of old love letters
hidden in the attic

after four hours of sleep
light snow fills
an empty cup

cold starry night -
from the forest edge the sound
of animal kill

temple courtyard
through the morning fog
peach blossoms

english newspaper
a lot of starving people
between fish  chips

while dusting buddha's mouth
is smile disappeared
for a few seconds

autumn storm
lightning flashes
on buddah's belly

new cracks
in an old mirror
I just noticed

tree less corners
the tall shadows
of beer bottles

hedgerow birds
three boys share a spliff
by the school gate

autumn chill
time for a hot bowl
of chili

frozen pond
the moon trapped
in a crack

chilled by spring winds
schoolgirls sniffing body spray
behind the gym

November night
the smell of burning leaves
and marshmallows

high summer
the sounds and smells
of a traveling fair

gentle breaths
the window's
frost etchings

quiet lake
the only sound
a jumping fish

meteor shower
in the cold our gasps
become visible

failing light
the ash tree
heavy with  birds

fall equinox
another day
in the  90's

evening   news
the burden of  snow
on my son's   balcony

under the snowpack
the garden  buddha
still keeps his smile

stoplight
each of us tapping
to our own beat

credit crunch -
a half-dozen fireworks
greet the new year

a lost child
in a ward of iron lungs
her daffodils

Mass over
the rush to be first
out of the lot

5am
bird songs lost
in air conditioner noise

guided hike
beyond the talk
quiet woods

at the feeder
more birds than room
the smell of snow

midwinter vanished
in a bite of homemade
strawberry preserves

while washing spinach
how nice to find
a haiku there

at the end
of a long learning curve
a helmut of white hair

bamboo flute
the scent
of green tea

Ashes, what was once a man,
and the full moon.
Bright, big, yellow.

empty room  
endless TV ads 
for nobody

almost home
the full moon between
two houses

pastry shop 
so many candy smiles
around me

summer's end -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying

parking for lovers 
many crocuses between
the wheel's traces

funeral procession
of the friend passes 
the crocus field

playing bowls,
playing at cards...
old warriors

driving towards
crematorium along
the frozen road

Independence Day
after the rainy morning
a sunny afternoon

autumn equinox 
fox's eyes shining
in the twilight

overturned boat,
drawn high on the shore -
drumming of rain

meteor shower 
crickets occupied
by its song

chilly tea-time 
finding new cyclamen leaves
in an old plant-pot.

watching Perseids 
a moth makes noise
on the porch

moths fluttering
in the paper lantern?
a shadow play

nobody's here -
only a cricket guards
the alpine hut

long lasting rain -
the dog-rose petals clung
to the pavement

summer's end  -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying

summer's end .
their chirping slows down -
good-bye, cicadas!

above the cemetery
laser beams from the disco 
a calm cricket chirp

the rose hides
the date of death
on her grave

sultry twilight 
pauses between bird's singing
become longer

courtyard of my childhood 
after so many dead people
the old lilac in bloom

afternoon tea 
the old climbing rose
somehow whiter

under floating clouds
the cherry blossom snow 
in the same direction

I completely forgot
the magnolia-tree,
till its bloom

I light on again
the candle on her grave
extuinguished by wind

first crowing
breaks my sleep 
year of Rooster

drinking mulled wine
on the square 
white breaths

late harvester 
sickle moon in the sky
over the mature corn

deep in the night
my computer turned off 
sound of autumn rain

crickets' songs
in the pitch-dark night 
how many secrets

nobody here
a table in the mountain
speckled with petals

 trains come and go
but the same people
drinks at bar

Eucharist
pious women still weeping
for Jesus 

little pawprints
in the concrete
from the lost kitten

brightening sky
the low from street lamps
still lingers
your late night words
suffuse my day with warmth

before my door
your footprints in the snow
from last night
how to absorb these echoes
of what we shared

her father's grave -
the little girl leaves a picture
of a dinosaur

Handel's Messiah
the same tapes my late-grandmother
listened to

late afternoon -
the fulness
of the cow's udder

late summer
butterfly wings clap
a little slower

full moon
pumpkins in the field
ready to pick

overcast-
curls of smoke
over a shared fence

New Year's Eve
the warmth of his eyes
over cold champagne

winter wonderland
even the burnt out car
looks beautiful

solstice birthday
blowing out a candle
for each decade

overcast day...
even the poppies
stay curled up

early dawn...
I watch the New Year
spill down the mountain

our greeting
between the honks
returning geese

clouds lifting
above the archipelago
morning light

the owl's whoo
unanswered
this autumn night

autumn morning
spreading marmalade
over burnt toast

autumn sun
slides through the blinds
withered sunflowers

candlelit pumpkin
the moths reflection
in the cat's eyes

New Year's Eve
bubbles rise again
in the old crystal flutes

almost Christmas 
thinking how best to reveal
that dad beats mum

at dusk...
the sweetness
of the roses

winter pears
eating around
the bruises

gibbous moon
the baby stirs
in her belly

autumn deepens
dusting off an old
bottle of port

election results
low tide clams
spit seawater

evening walk
acorn shells crunch
into the silence

empty bus stop
autumn leaves swirl
in the car's wake

flu season
to kiss
or not to kiss?

drought-
weeds sprouting
near the sprinkler

death watch...
I freshen the water
of her bedside iris

circle time
she describes her mother
finding a vein

at the cottage...
last year's mosquitoes
on the bedroom wall

spring cleaning...
painting over
last year's mosquitoes

midnight.
the stallion's single kick
against the wall

quiet stable...
the sudden force
of horse piss

drought...
the first raindrops
bounce

overcast -
the next door pianist
hits a sour note

downpour -
the pumpkin's smile
goes out

we sip sweet tea
in silence...
a soldier's mother

autumn visit -
over war news we talk
of babies...

fireside -
a son's face smiles down
from the mantelpiece

setting gibbous moon a golden jellyfish drifts under our kayak

in the yard
between our argument -
a red dragonfly

more rain -
mildew colors
the old roof

half asleep -
the rhythm of the
receding rain

wild iris
in the marsh
unreachable

night rain -
Chopin's nocturne
drowns it out 

summer rain -
lightning whites out
the street lights

the crow -
balancing on a wire
and now, in the wind

midnight -
only jasmine now
and cricket song

equinox -
the bulbul's song on the edge
between day and night

spring evening -
a boy hums the tune I heard
half a mile ago

Valentine's Day
a forsythia
without birds

tattered clouds -
the moon's whiteness is
icier tonight

unaimed day -
beneath the flipped stone
five black beetles 

cricket song
softly, outlasting
the trucks

red poppies...
the butterfly always just
out of reach

night silence -
despite the dogs, despite
a crying baby

monsoon clouds - 
a heron bathes in a pool
of light

night rain
a bat wings its way to
tomorrow

unhurried
the egret whiter
than the clouds

veins of lightning
split the sky - 
smell of wet earth

moonless
suddenly the silence
bigbangs into barking

head cold -
missing the scent
of winter heliotrope

early spring air
all day long
our beds not made

rain on leaves tiles earth 
flute notes slither through
the water sounds 

grey-yellow dawn
a dove's urgent cooing
and the rain

still night -
the smell of fried fish drowns out
the traffic sounds

through the window
half a mirror showing
a quarter room

cool breeze -
a thousand things undone
I watch the moon

storm-washed sky -
the bird songs
clearer

midnight -
my earphones
keep out the silence

darkening street -
two babblers on a wire
and then the moon

midnight -
the windy silence
of the sickle moon

after the solstice
this summer heat
still the same

husband away
washing his socks
by hand

night drizzle
is that donkey's braying
filled with pain?

hot oil sizzles
on an iron frying pan
kitchen god speaks

darkening trees -
a flight of parakeets
brightly lit

silver moon
a loudspeaker barks
at the night

midday heat - 
the insistent call
of a dove

noon heat - 
a pigeon shadow shimmers
across the tar

unanswered
the dog's howl fades
into the night

roadside cricket song - 
the full moon's risen
above the wires

day of remembrance -
the night silence
same as always

Internet break - 

between memories
and the parents' grave
the curtain of rain

evening voices
the moon
so huge

rusty fence - 
a sunbird
in one of the diamonds

the rising moon pales
down here the cricket's
unwavering song 

high-stepping,
an egret walks its shadow
across a white wall

bulbul blues
a yellow flower floats
in my tea cup

lakeside
the long silence
before the loon's reply

getting the phone - 
the soft tapping
of the rocking chair

rabbit in the moon
each dog has the last bark
till the next

cold night
a cricket's
insistent mantra

cloudy
the metal-edged whistle
of a dove's flight

my sweaty skin 
enough for three weeks
his ironed shirts

moon-paved road
I take the lane
without the dogs

haze over the hills
the rain has filled
this morning's footprints

night silence
a facebook cry
of loneliness

deep silence
that crack in the wall
looks wider tonight

the moon's emerged
now water drips only
under the trees 

last light
listening for the silence
behind the rain

night rain -
baking smells from the house
with the jasmine

brown earth
a hawk's reflection glides
across the puddle

rain on the leaves
just one
firefly

night rain
a bus rumbles through
the croaking of frogs

broken
magnolia bloom
still inviting bees

red sun
the air glitters
with dragonflies

dim porch light
I spit orange seeds
into the darkness

shrilling cicadas
two women smile
at something else

between fiery clouds
and shadowed earth
a string of egrets

another year
the inscription hard to read
with all the grass

naked light bulb
the rain on the leaves
barely audible

roosting egrets
the lake's silence settles
on everything

petal-strewn earth
a mynah hops into
a patch of sunlight

declining moon
the old man's laughter
turns to coughing

February chill
a punctured heart balloon
bright red in the dust

beggar's steps
at the bakery
slower and slower

darkening trees
the steady shrilling
of cicadas

election results
the muezzin's call
like a lament

almost full moon
knowing what's for dinner
I still check it out

same moon
same song
another cricket

rumble of thunder
the hawk-like flight
of the pigeon

starry fireworks
a smoke cloud
drifts past Orion

night walk
I slow down
near the jasmine bush

Beware Of Dog sign
the bright pink tongue
of the puppy

cold sky
after my friend's cremation
I water the garden

a cricket falls silent
the clock's slow ticking
goes on

bus stop -
all eyes
on the migrating geese

morning mist
the sun does not reach
the side lane

now what?
the papaya tree has reached
the cement awning

past midnight
and a dripping tap
a man's voice somewhere

neon light
the leaves of the bush
almost black

wedding band 
smoke from the fireworks
dissolves against the stars

half-empty train
the hand-holds sway
in unison

a break in the clouds
spider webs and plastic bags
catch the morning light

blackout:
morning glories appear
in the car's headlights

distant temple drums
close by the sound of a dog
shaking itself

hot night -
after my bath
the world seems cleaner

dusk-
fireflies leading the way
to the car door

steaming tea
dusty cobwebs above
the late owner's photo

lemon slice moon
a kite glides past
the palmyra palm

cycle cart -
the office chairs' legs
point to the moon

muezzin's call
a kite's silhouette
beneath orange clouds

muezzin's call
a one-horned cow pushes
at the hotel gate

smoky moon
a cricket's regular chirp
between the traffic noise

fluffed-up sparrows
the air white with snowflakes
above the tar

anti-war demo
snowflakes melt
on the horse's backside

cold rain
a bunch of daffodils
against the brick wall

blinding snow
man and dog tracks
run together

long drive home
grass poking through
fresh fallen snow

night stillness
a new mail
in the inbox

Valentine's Day
a red rose
stuck in the snow

snow melt 
chewing gum spots appear
on the pavement

loud pub music
a long silence
between the flirting couple

orthopaedic clinic
a three-legged chair
outside the entrance

the plane's landing lights
a wave of barking
sweeps the neighbourhood

hot afternoon
a flirting couple
in the memorial's shade

last red in the sky
a small girl's moon face rises
over the counter

day moon
the woman with silver hair
steps back into the shade

Science day
the programme begins
with rituals

rushing to work
seeing frozen new leaves
on the rose bush

traffic argument
the camel's sneer
is impartial

traffic jam
three saffron-robed men munch nuts
in their SUV

eddying leaves
the old woman's wrinkled face
and saree

morning mist
the iora is gone
before I recall its name

drifting fog
the house across the road
reappears

long-distance train
men on the platform
talk on their mobiles

two minutes silence
a cell phone keeps ringing
Nehru smiles from his frame

Venus
a faint glow
from the refinery

road accident
a crowd of teddies stares out
from the shop window

grey sky
the cluster of white breaks up
into egrets

new highway -
every mile or so
the corpse of a buzzard

Morning Paper
twice the colored ad inserts
as the news

night traffic
the silent lake
seems much bigger

last light
sounds of crows settling
in the tree

deep night
one cricket chirps
anyhow

ants transport a moth
traffic noise penetrates
the bamboo grove

afternoon lull
the traffic island
crowded with pigeons

bike tail lights
a lingering smell
of perfume

quiet lane
after the jasmine
smell of fried onions

fallen tree
the poor woman's axe
gleams brightly

muddy street
the black pig's feet
and tail tip are white

unkempt garden
a hibiscus blooms
amongst the weeds

packing up house
boxes of broken dreams
filling the dumpster

sunset
the shopkeeper burns incense
to drive out mosquitoes

sudden rain
cows crowd the entrance
to the hotel

opulent temple
pigeons occupy
every niche

cloudburst
the flies are already
in the house

soft rain
the sound of hammering
from the construction site

 day moon -
the girl brushing her hair
smiles suddenly

home again
even the ants
seem familiar

cool morning
a fog of insecticide
in the red truck's wake

flight of egrets
a boy stands with his ear
to a telephone pole

last station
the king of hearts on the floor
of the compartment

driving home
full moon
dancing in puddles

crystal morning
dried puke
on the car door

midnight
the moon dances
in my teacup

burnt-down house
yellow elders bloom
in the garden

waiting for moonrise
the moving red dot
becomes a plane

harsh sunlight
faces peep through the bars
of the police van

moonrise
a woman croons
to her baby

empty street
the For Sale sign
overgrown with weeds

gust of wind
a womanâ€™s face lights up
by the cooking fire

a bullock cart
loaded high with shoe boxes
the driverâ€™s cracked feet

small talk
sixteen ants on the wall...
seventeen...

at the hotel
plugging in my laptop
for a touch of home

petrol fumes
smell of fresh bread
from the bakery

clacking rails
five languages
in the compartment

rice-green pond
dark herons stand
in an arc

sultry afternoon
little mirages
above the tar

melting tar
silk cotton drifts
across the road

smoky moon
a cloud of insects around

I order a glass of rosÃ©

on a fire hydrant
I tie my shoesbehind me
a dog waits its turn

winter morning
too many men
wearing grey suits

cold nightI pass the statue
of a man wearing
a winter coat

February First
a sun ray dances
on her cell phone

extreme cold weather
the stars shine
more brightly

very cold day
a stuffed bear
stays under the bed covers

the price of tortillas
goes up
let them eat ethanol

soft spoken
her jewelry and music
are heavy metal

blizzard
too much powdered sugar
even for Valentine Day

the empty bench 
spilled coffee
turned to ice

gloomy afternoon
a red haired woman
smiles at me

snacking on
blue corn chips
moonless night

at a general statue
a dog salutes
by raising its leg

cold Saturday night
the barmaid puts sake
in my green tea

beautiful winter dawn
I ran out of
Jasmine tea

strange faces are out
this saturday night
the moon

early morning
last night stardust
is on the lilacs

morning haze
I keep recounting
how many Santas

morning commute
the silence
of end of the year stress

overcast morning
not enough sugar
in the rice pudding

autumn chill -
struggling to remember
my father's voice

working Saturday 
the small shadows of pigeons
in the fog

morning rush
a blonde
with no lipstick

Autumn sunset
a birthday balloon
rises

Fifth Avenue station
the sound of hoofs
on the pavement

grey morning
I check out a new
tanning salon

a bartender
needs more olives
the bridge lights turn on

a dog patiently
waits for his plate
Thanksgiving Day

Black Friday
so many turkeys
at the sales

the harvest is over
I hang the sickle
crescent moon

Autumn morning
neighborhood graffiti
has changed colors

hell
a homeless man
wears a new garbage bag

the puddled field 
blades of grass
pierce a cloud

overcast day
I look at old pictures
in black and white

my morning train
delayeda seagull
flies above the tracks

Autumn night
a homeless man
has a pumpkin

she wears a purple blouse
at sunset
I order espresso

October last Sunday
lost an hour
resetting an old clock

wave-sound
the smooth stone
fits my hand

half-dark sky
a slow roll of thunder
joins the cicada

drifting jet trails
half a haiku searches
for enlightenment

lee of the storm
the jagged edges
of the new pothole

flash of lightning
the salesman's oily manner
slips

morning haze 
ice drifts around
the river stones

bleached driftwood
the sand on the floor migrates
to the dustpan

deep fog
i wish i had another
cup of tea

blurry stars
the jasmine bloom
fills the air

lupine pools
another memory stirs
my nostalgia

globe lilies
an empty place
at the supper table

heat wave
the cat opens one eye
halfway

early stars
the weed-choked path
to the compost

haiku potato chips
nobody can write
just one

new leaves
the same old face
in the mirror

fine gray rain
a flashmob of santas
in union square

berry stains
along the sidewalk 
hint of frost

hurried steps
my frosty breath rises towards
the half moon

undecided voter
half a moon hangs
in the noon sky

autumn chill
the blind poodle caught
in the phone cord again

chemo drip
i wish i could give you the moon
instead

waning moon
the cricket behind the fridge
starts singing

autumn chill
her long fingernails drum
with the rain

farmer's market
checking out the guy
checking me out

neglected garden
the sweet peas
stage a riot

leafless maple
she fingers the wool
of his last chemo cap

black lace and moonlight
her underthings draped
over the chair

a bright morning 
the mud pulls away
from a frosty stone

empty bottle
we start singing
another old tune

fresh peaches 
the wet print of your body
on the pool deck

night on the town 
the scent of mackerel
on the fog

indian summer 
an unsealed letter
on the table

flute song 
the faint scent
of the easter lily

april stars 
two brass buttons
on the nightstand

lunch break 
the scent of apple blossoms
in the sunshine

nightfall 
shooting stars
on the power lines

mixed rain and sleet
the hothouse rose drops
another petal

distant siren
the hurricane lantern swings
on its hook

walking meditation 
I pass through
a cloud of breath

fine rain 
a faded plastic flower
on the window

october clouds
grease stains in relief
on the highway

indian summer 
the ceiling fan creaks
on startup

cold snap
the refrigerator freezes
the lettuce

november sunshine
the taste of lemon pepper
on my lips

gray thanksgiving
an outburst of laughter
from the kitchen

winter twilight
the warmth of his back
against mine

summer stars 
my husband starts snoring
again

chemo drip
i wish i could give you the moon
instead

evening 
the scent of water
on asphalt

new coolness 
a train's light moves
along the mountainside

day is done
poppies amidst the dying grass

day moon
cottonwoods shimmer
in the breeze

distant thunder 
another iris opens
its petals

prayer group
eight candle flames flicker
with our breath

stone fountain
rust stains
in the empty bowl

hiroshima day
the first meteors fall
silently

spent dandelions
a weather-beaten lawn chair
on the bare patch 

unknown soldier
a fallen comrade carried
by two ants

tall grass
an old DeSoto
beyond the old Dodge

somber skies
drifts of dead fir needles
on the road

wispy clouds 
the last blossom hangs
on the fireweed

erosion 
a flattened possom
in the road

mosquitoes rise
the damp scent of clean clothes
on the line

hot and humid
the tea kettle dribbles
onto the counter

first light 
cherry leaves heavy
with rain

ethnic cleansing
the colored woman scrubs
the white toilet

evening prayer
hailstones rattle
the windows

piano recital
a steady drone
from the coke machine

sudden hail
the child's marble bag bursts
as he runs indoors

distant thunder
the sharpness in her voice
after my comment

blind curve
dogwood flowers unfold
in the rain

new coolness 
a pool at the center
of the lupine leaves

new book 
the hands of the clock move
faster

march warmth
the taste of curry
on his lips

false spring
the minty freshness
of his kiss

popping gum
the vacant look
in her eyes

wind and rain 
wisteria blooms entwine
the barbed wire fence

sensuous lips
the young man tells me
about his fresh fruit

sudden chill 
my aunt corrects
the children's manners

winter's end
another bite
of green curry

spring gale
raindrops on the raw wood
of the new fence

tart raspberries
evening comes earlier
and earlier

sirens 
the wind pushes
a butterfly to the ground

half-light
the cat turns and washes
one paw

armistice day
a rainbow of wool drying
on the clothesline

summer love
a faded red t-shirt rots
in the gutter

september grasses
the rumble of a distant
trash cart

lofty thoughts
the crowns of the redwoods
lost in the clouds

dry haystack
the muffled sound
of rain

morning tai chi
my form wavers
with the barking dogs

leftover meatloaf
we have an argument
about his ex-wife

midsummer stars
the cry of a loon shatters
the darkness

railroad tracks
summer shadows fade
into twilight

september rays -
my son's shadow
lengthens

noon glare 
the wind blows sand
out to sea

summer evening
crescents of cantaloupe
on a blue plate

fresh tea
the warmth of his lips
on mine

high summer
a cloud of flies
over the road kill 

neglected garden
the sweet peas
stage a riot

prayers
for a dying friend 
azaleas in bloom

tax morning
my undrunk tea cold
in the cup

samhain night
another wreath
goes up in smoke

moving day
a wet maple leaf sticks
to the mattress

drought's end
she scribbles haiku on the back
of her grocery list

chocolate santas 
do you bite the head off
or nibble the toes?

dog days 
driving to the lake
to watch the icebergs drift

california dreaming
a white christmas
inside the snow globe

church bells
she leaves her good intentions
in her hymnal

grandpa in his coffin
she sings a lullaby
before they close the lid

no moon
the hiss of the ocean
against the cliff

half-mast 
september sunshine streams
through green maple leaves

october haze
a frayed american flag
on the new pickup

turning leaves
red, white and blue bunting
covers the mailbox 

retirement community
speed bumps
in the cul-de-sac

woodland graffiti
a fallen branch carved
by bark beetles

all souls day
the scent of smoke lingers
in my hair

after the rain 
a frog-shaped shadow
wavers in the puddle

slow river 
a wave of cirrus clouds breaks
across the sky

summer fog 
layers of color
in the sand

fog lifting
the bean vines climb
a little higher

afternoon nap
the hippopotamus opens
its nostrils

fourth of july 
a mosquito waves
its striped leg

slug trail 
the truck dumps asphalt
in the paver

finished compost 
the vegetable garden feasts
on chocolate cake 

full summer 
yellow leaves among the green
in the laurel

farmer's market
checking out the guy
checking me out

four am 
the silence between tick
and tock

hugs 
the spider on my
old friend's arm

temper tantrum 
the ring of the axe blade
on redwood

same old moon
the blur of insects
against the stars

hot morning
a bright red poppy buzzes
with seven bees

brake lights
on the beach freeway 
heat rise 

scent of autumn 
the first bite of an apple
crunchy and sweet

october wind 
the baby drops the leaf
again

back porch campout 
the tall trees darker than
the summer sky 

almost dusk 
the quarrel of children
in the treehouse

empty teacup 
the laundry basket
overflows

open suitcase 
she reads the oncology report
backwards

spray painted log 
I try not to sit
on the word f***

tilted fence 
layers of shadows
on the ivy

autumn twilight 
an algebra book open
on the couch

sleepless night 
a new tooth
in the baby's smile

twilight 
pools of lupine
in the deep meadow grass

high bridge 
the soundless splashes
of dropped stones

shaking out crumbs 
the smell of rain
on asphalt

fourth of july
a cottonwood blizzards
on the picnic

spent tea leaves 
the scent of almonds
and cinnamon

black lace and moonlight
her underthings draped
over the chair

rainy day 
precipitation
in the baby's nappy

a few yellow leaves 
the construction site grows
towards my favorite tree

coming home
piles of laundry on the floor
light and dark

morning tai chi 
a breeze stirs the spent petals
of the cherry blossoms

cloudburst 
an apple tree rains petals
on the asphalt

haiku 
attentive to this moment
i smile

wet starless night 
a smiling moon shines
on her umbrella.

autumn chill
a faint rainbow
in the shower

flute song 
the faint scent
of the easter lily

nightfall 
shooting stars
on the power lines

endless summer 
another beach boys tune
on the oldies station

labor day 
another company cuts
health benefits

week of rain 
the insect's trail
on the flattened leaf

distant hawk
a gust of cherry petals
crosses the lawn

day is done
poppies amidst
the dying grass

celtic harp
the first raindrops touch
my cheeks

desire
the honey
inside me

february 15th
a broken heart
in the cookie box

lost friendship
a stray wisp of fog clings
to the canyon

open suitcase 
she reads the oncology report
backwards

contact lenses 
the pines on that hill clear
for the first time

birdsong 
the rush of the river
over stones

spring afternoon 
the leaf shadow spreads
on the pond

a winged ant
crawls on hot asphalt 
end of summer

morning tai chi 
a breeze stirs the spent petals
of the cherry blossoms

final phase
the bedside nurse
reads a fairy tale.

heaviness July
a homeless fans
with cardboard

unmade bed
a smile on the edge
the empty flute

minus forty-six
steam from the coffee
warms my nose

equinox
all the colors of autumn
in the sky

Winter solstice
tangerine essence
in my bath water

anonymous room
shadow splashing gray
the unnamed woman

Honey and coffee
bodied smell permeating
the crumpled sheets

Waves on the beach
noise rollers rolling
under our embrace

discount store
the unfinished tattoo
on the cashier's arm

Work in the garden
hot sweat smell
and oregano

autumn's end
the air smells
different

candlelight bath
the steam rises
from my toes

Now the shore is grey
and the wind is sharp with rain.
Some day we'll sit close
on these white rocks, talking of
nothing in particular.

in a shoebox
all the candles
of uncelebrated birthdays

breezy afternoon
  running my hands
  across the cool sheets


moonlit night
across the meadow
my shadow grows

summer dust 
a caterpillar under
the whale bone arch

after the storm
puddles of water
with rainbows

alone
in the tea house
rainy night

black ice
covers the street
uprooted tree

a butterfly
hovers above me
friend's funeral

sad words
and tears in my teacup
rainstorm

moldy odors
in the nursing home
dying elders

mason jar
full of dead fireflies
dark night

lost in her mind
fields of white daisies
and summer

only two pinecones
on the park bench 
Valentine's day

Still under white sheet
his body four hours later-
Rain beats on pavement.

giorni piÃ¹ brevi
nella cesta dei cachi
un grillo morto

Sunday best
his overalls
washed and ironed

a white night 
salmon bones
curled against a log

cool night air
city noises fade away
memories

cool night air
folding chair
meditations

market day
hot tired shoppers
wait for the free bus

call to prayer
roosters too
fresh morning air

dog barks
somebody starts their car
summer's morning light

memorial day weekend
watering plants
remembering 

deer carcass
alongside the highway
silently accepts the rainstorm

is spring coming
bombs raining down
on tripoli on aljazeera

winter session
in the kitchen
my cracked teacup

after winter sesshin
sharing tea
silence

scent of new leaves 
a caterpillar swings
in a shaft of light

winter's cold
dreaming
of my ex-wife

the sulphuric scent
of winter coal
out for a walk

sometimes
sunny sundays in november
are unfair

sunny sunday in november
half assembled shelves
wait in the kitchen

sunday in autumn
neighbor needs money
for her cancer meds

november email
remembering sycamores
outside the window

october over
listening to heavy rain
call to prayer

heavy steady rain
back pain
skipped friday prayer

heavy steady rain
through windows through wet trees
the lake in the rain

passover
moon
through the bare branches

half-frog pose
I lie and listen
to the rain

The Holy Land
no heat no food no water
craters

new fire old coals
in the old stove
new year

rainstorm
guests huddle with candles
waiting for dinner

after an hour of rain
the crickets
all seem happy

kumquats with Russian tea
then slowly
I undress Ellen

in the hyacinth garden
I sneak a kiss
between Jimmy's lips

September 11th
steady slow soft
rain

full moon
full ripe figs
end of summer

solstice
after the last match
the last call to prayer

spring
full moon
new roses

spring currents 
the first gulls
picking bones

at anchor
tankers
wide blue sea white sky

all night long on the veranda
drinking tea and talking
about God and our new parrot

picking flowers
an explosion of color
crosses the minefield

a thousand prayers
from valley folds and mountains
paper cranes

Spring rain-
I sit looking
out the window

cold nose
burrow of warm flannel -
morning light

cherry trees
fifty shades
of pink

one small step... 
I trace my toe in sand 
dream of lunar dust

Mother's Day
the smell of roses
near a grave.

winter twilight -
she studies the face
in her mirror

a hawk searches
the dry grass 
sundogs

just one more page
before I sleep...
endless rain

winter rain...
she places his flowers
in the second-best vase

fading light -
a red leaf bouquet
at the smallest grave

spring rain -
as the doctor speaks
i think of lilacs

false dawn
sometimes i still
think of home

first frost -
a twirl of yellow leaves
as the bus passes

plasma tv -
in high resolution
the homeless man's face

sparrow song
two ladies on the verandah
just before the rain

summer wind
the blue jay's reflection
in the birdbath

Right, left
The flash of the float plane's light
Rain on the forest 

the courtship songs
of so many birds 
wind through my shirt

the crunch
of the first leaf
a sweet sigh

the sound
of the first fallen leaf
this Autumn day

2 am
rain and wind on the island
another insomnia night

Soft rain
her thoughts of lost love
intrude into her day

He looks at her
underlying chill in the air
smell of rain

Another day without him
she misses all the little things
still, the sun shines

3 am
a scycle moon 
thoughts of him
crowd my brain
and takes my sleep 

cancer clinic visit
day breaking from the night
a seaplane is waiting

feelings of joy
float in and out
red seaweed 

Counting the shades
of grey in the sea
and in his hair
Comptant les teintes
de gris de la mer
et de ses cheveux 

scent of rain 
a whale-shaped cloud
hangs over the bay

On the pillow
his bouquet of wild flowers
this last day of Spring

Dusting off the ancestors
and stirring up memories
Spring cleaning

Another day of rain
her tears fall also
which is which

waiting for the sun
the clouds hide his face
first cup of coffee

awake at 3 am
she drags her kimono
from room to room

Cancer clinic visit
a bald woman passes by
with a smile

a milky sea
mass of logs sit and rest
as an eagle soars 

finally a day of sun
here in the rain forest
freckles on my face

From the tidal pool
Two crabs in an embrace
Today's lunch

Buddhist monks chat
On the 49th day of the disaster
Looking for lost souls

lulled to sleep
by gutter sounds 
spring dreaming

Dawn
The night separating from the day
A bird's song

On the table
Apple blossom branches
A new scent

Forever waiting
For the ring of the phone
Watching the rain

In the hospital
Watching the clouds drift by
Sharp needle in the hand

Grey and rainy
Going with my Mother
To a senior's complex

Soft rain
My Mother and I look
At retirement homes

Rainy February day
Cloud after cloud after cloud
Pray for a clear day

Chilly morning
Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind

Home again
His scent lingers
On her kimono

Awoken at 4 am
The honking of Canada geese
Spring is here

a cold morning 
goose honks echo
off the pavement

Snowballs
her seasonal cookies
eaten one by one

Grey surrounds
wind blows in from the window 
Advents candles blow out

Winter solstice
too many things to do
this shortest of days

On the island
the first snowfall
red gloves

First mandarin
sweet and sour taste
scent of Christmas

Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue
thoughts fly to you

A wind up frog
hops across the wooden floor
thoughts of haiku 

On the weight scale
too many extra pounds
Autumn's abundance

Summer's day
the clink of ice cubes
in my gin and tonic

Crunch, crunch, crunch
stepping on fallen acorns
this Autumn day 

steamed milk 
snowmelt running from
the coffee shop roof

Rain clouds
patches of blue in the sky
first cup of coffee

In the morning darkness
coffee cup in hand
missing the sunshine

Fall morning
fog resting on cedars
cup of Kona

Fall afternoon
the boat on the river
slow heart beating

Hazy skies
the cedars less dark
this Summer day

Crickets in the garden
time passing me by
Mother's ageing hands 

My son's birthday
not sharing the cake
chasing the seagull away 

cloudless night
she looks into the mirror
counting new wrinkles

Cloudy sky
the sun a bright red
first cup of coffee

(Rain filled morning
i hold my face upward
tears like rain

conformation
the steady drip...drip...drip...drip...
of maple sap 

between the yoga
and chi gung classes 
scent of burning sage

Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes

visit to the old villa
the scent of
lost money

After the Solstice
already feeling the touch
of Winter

The red breasted bird
outside the cancer clinic 
Spring nest building now 

Dark spring morning
busy conversation of birds
awakens interest

Morning sunshine bright
chases all worry from cancer
operation success 

Dancing in the yard
rows of tidy daffodils
oh so very yellow

A float plane
divides the Canada geese
Summer stillness

Summer solstice
the smoke of bonfires
hill after hill

Spring cleaning today
dead ladybug on the window
memory of lost love

dawn storm 
a bit of mountain ash
stirred into the snow

Cold sea
and warm air merge
fog horns

scent of seaweed
drifts into the cemetery
i walk alone

In the cemetary
around his headstone
first snowdrops

a slow walk
to the cemetery
memory of blue irises 

Through the fog
a few spots of red
first Robins

Old chestnut tree
white candles sway
Spring wind

Ides of March
her letter to him
pain in his heart

Lights of the ferry 
leave the island of cedars
in deep dark shadow

The full December moon
he counts his birthdays
snow on the temple

The Advent wreath
candles lighting the dim room
his old eyes shinning

horizonless 
sky-colored ice
turns in the bay

November morning 
counting the many
shades  of grey

Chilly morning 
mountains topped with first snow
warm coffee cup

Snow covered temple 
lone woman in a red coat
kneels to pray anyway

Indian Summer 
his voice in the fall
of the leaves

Through the  pulp mill smoke
A long red line is showing 
Start of a sunrise

The rushing river 
full of the Summer's
rainfall

The Budapest square 
Autumn leaves drift  here and there
on  young protestors

Dark August sky
the moon an orange egg 
her shadow trailing

Summer morning 
the sound of wind chimes
on every balcony

This Dark and grey day 
a soft rain falling down on
the heat-dried roses

sharp air 
the patch of blue
changes shape

Tonight on my deck
setting sun the longest time
bring memories back

Rain-laden cedars
my skin feels so moist today
scent of yellow rose

On this dark grey day
my thoughts wander to a pair
of  blue irises

A bone scan today
on the way three birds on the
rose scented old path

Hovering grey sky
a small crack in the thick clouds
fishing boats come in

Late night jazz
the singer's voice sounds dark
in the smoky cafe

the voice of the singer
looks black
in the smoky cafe

Five years of haiku
in a  large paper box
on top, the cat

The morning birds
such a clear sweet sound 
making my bed

A Rainy cool day
promise of Kona coffee
from Honolulu

daylight moon 
the shadows of bubbles
under the ice

Belated and elated
your gift of a blue candle
for my birthday

In the early morning
down on the white beach 
a turtle without eyes

Heavy March rain
the Daffodils hang their heads
my heavy thoughts

Clear Spring night
again i am thinking of you
waiting for stars to fall

Moon over cedars
in the rainforest
scent of you

Cherry blossoms
patients line up at the clinic
sweet scent

In the rainforst
moss hung trees
sound of silence

I check the calendar
to see if this is a special day 
International Women's Day

Late Winter
the yellow roses still  out
soft feel of snow

In a vase
twelve blue irises
late winter storm

fog patches 
a second little face
in the sonogram

March sunrise
rays of red and gold through clouds
a fishing boat returns

Yellow Winter roses
mist over the garden
sound of fog horn

At midnight
the fog horn in the mist
yellow roses

What was a storm
now lies wet and white
on the ground

Spring day
cool and grey
cup of tea

Grey today
the waves rush
memories

Spring morning
your hand on my breast
a bird

Parting the fog
blue nose of the ferry
homeward bound

Autumn sky
many layers of clouds
pile of leaves

Autumn sky
shades of pink and purple
field of pumkins

spin cycle 
snow flakes swirl outside
the laundromat

First day of autumn
splash of a spawning salmon
another cycle begins

Last day of September
bay and islands in fog
aroma of coffee

First day of October
the morning sun in my eyes
clank of the furnace

A fine mist
covers the tall cedars
foggy glasses

At breakfast
after first sip of coffee
i notice a rainbow

Wild fires rage
scent of cedar
fills the air

Over the bay
August full moon rises
as days shorten

Reading a book
a sudden brightness
the full moon

High winds
trees down on power lines
no morning coffee

On a grey day
a spot of colour
his red hair

lifting fog 
a few white feathers
in the raven's breast

In the room
white lillies in the vase
scent of pepper

Federal Express
reaches me through the fog
plumeria lei

Talking with you
now this morning somehow
scent of plumeria

Red as the poppy
maple leaves fall
on the memorial

Light-studded ferry
passes in the starless night
another week-end

A tunnel of fog
connects the two islands
warmth of my duvet

October morning
a new pair of new wool socks
on my very cold feet

First day of Autumn
even your touch feels
somewhat cooler

Last night of Summer
the bright full moon of last night
hidden by a cloud

All my lights off
to watch the rising
of the Harvest moon

bank thermometers 
the temperature changes
all the way home

The sunrise
fresh salmon on ice
so very pink

Midnight and full moon
my neighbour asks to borrow
the vacum cleaner

The blue iris
colour changing hue
soft Summer rain

A sea change
the weather turns cool
hot rum and lemon

At last some sunshine
blue Pacifc this morning
boiling tea water

In this desert
a memory of blue sea 
shells in the sand

Autumn mist obscures
the island in the distance
she cleans her glasses

In the forest
patches of blue between
the tall pines

The tall pines
etched against the sky
late September

Nun and monk
watching the blue heron
fishing in the bay

subzero 
the icicles filled
with moonlight

Nun and monk
read the book together
in two tongues

The curved cheek
of the young monk
sunlight on the bay

rainy day
in the rainforest
drip, drip, drip

the seasons change
she buys new
colour contacts

winter night
hot buttered rum
fog on glasses

grey sea and sky
she dreams of
blue irises

after the party
a lone woman drinks
a birthday gift

Wind howls and
the cedars sway 
drunken sailors

An ocean breeze
flips through empty pages 
haijin's notebook

long after
the witching hour
a candle flutters

the wolf howl lingers
fades into the night's
eerie silence

long cold snap 
the icicle
begins to fork

Pressed among pages
of old dictionary
a list of action verbs

one hundred views
of the sunrise -
appartment block

predawn
a grey dove outside
my window

solstice
a shaft of sunlight
through rock

rainburst
thoughts of you
fading

straw hat -
flowers fading
under the sun

New sheets.
I remember
your hands.

shaking the stone from her shoe -
a white opal swings
from between her brown breasts

summer butterfly
a girl wearing a white dress
in the morning breeze

soft jazz
candle light and lip gloss
in the corner 

low clouds 
a gull circles above
the police car light

Earth Day...
slowly the anesthetic
takes effect

August 6
my father does not say
good morning

cloudburst 
the last nail hammered 
in the rain

autumn chill
the mausoleum covered
with sparrows

autumn chill
the chalkboard screeches
at her touch 

signal station
a woodpecker taps
in the dusk

snow flurries :::
a blue jay's feather
clings to the yard 

snow glare
onion bulbs sprouting 
from the bag

geriatric ward
the table groans
when they fold it up

sun dog
so many names
carved on the cliff 

snowy banks 
the drifting duck leans
into a curve

Easter
an anxious mother calls
in the wind

breathless 
camellias falling
one by one

starless night
Las Vegas spills
over the desert

fragile morning
a blue psilocybin in the middle
of the garden

dusk
the space between us
filling with snow

spring wind 
the magnolia sweeps
the sky

night shift 
he tree frogs sing a road
through the forest

a dark horse
with a blue harness .
winter solstice

cold spring 
burnt waffles
and raspberry jam

mid-summer 
the nighthawk cries between
Pittsburgh and heaven

a long split
in the black inky cap 
snow clouds

on the roof late 
my brother hammers nails
in the moon

home for Christmas
the fruitcake we always
pretended to like

autumn leaves
my fear
of falling 

cold moon
the sound of my words
in her eyes

the heat...
a silent fountain
drenched in moonlight

trick or treat
I promise the vampire
the dog won't bite

fireworks over...
the silence
of the stars

walking home
after the rainbow
a crescent moon

Omaha Beach
the sound of wave
after wave

Memorial Day
old enough to remember
a time between wars

dusk
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam

monsoon season raindrops dot the dust

Memorial Day
we try to remember
when the war began

drifting from dream to dream hazy moon

she tells me I missed
a beautiful sunrise
black no sugar

children's voices
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed

her obituary...
the things we did
that summer

a homeless man
rises from the sidewalk
Easter morning

snowmelt...
my neighbor and I forget
we're not speaking

brightening sky
after the eclipse
a skylark's song

steady rain
a little salt
in my beer

season's end 
the scent of fish
drifts downstream

crescent moon
the new home still full
of echoes

first pussy willow
I open my notebook
of unfinished poems

the curved back
of a garden Buddha
winter rain

year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve

deep in the woods
leaves drifting over
what used to be a wall 

autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits

autumn leaves
I follow
their drift

where the carpet
is wearing thin
autumn sunlight

as old as I feel
on a gray morning...
autumn equinox

evening calm
her garden the color
of moonlight

new coolness 
a cloud passes through
the mountain notch

awake
in the dark
the darkness

narrow path
I make way
for the butterfly

coming home...
the scent of the ocean
before the sound

Labor Day
a fly buzzing around
the leftovers

poor neighborhood
a dog barking at the end
of a rope

vacant lot
hardly worth
a haiku

steady rain
where the bookstore
used to be

class reunion
an old friend's glance
at my name tag 

Easter vigil
candle flames tremble
at our breath

just passing through...
a parking lot where I saw
Gone with the Wind

soft rain
fishing line parts
a cloud of gnats

train window
the landscape coming 
to a stop

almost spring
her pink scarf taken
by the wind

a furniture store
where the church used to be 
vernal equinox

midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight

waving goodnight
after the party
the chill

the white coffin
she was buried in
this winter light

first snow
a walk through fallen leaves
to my childhood

harvest moon
the things I have left
undone

harvest moon
she tells him
she's late

downtown
pointing the way
with her cigarette

evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea

twelve years old
learning to pronounce
Hiroshima

an infant asleep
on her mother's lap...
this heat

the silence
around our words...
fireflies

winter moon
a tired old man
in the mirror

the laughter of children
running uphill . . 
Gettysburg

waiting up
for their teenaged daughter...
distant fireworks

evening rain
she lets down
her hair

at the end
of a long afternoon
my faded shadow

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret

only the wind
off the ocean
Omaha Beach

how quickly
the nights grow longer 
fireweed in bloom

a few petals
left by the sweeper...
sunset clouds

locked out
I write a haiku
about daffodils

under a sky
of no particular color
dandelions

another spring
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed

powdering the dog
a child asks if fleas
go to heaven

Valentine's Day
shaking the snow
from the roses

a toast
to the departing year -
snow turns to rain

after a storm
the absence
of a tree

waiting room
the steady hum 
of the fish tank

in the nursing home
she talks about the brother
no one talks about

winter temptation
in the seed catalogues
perfect tomatoes

the evening train
almost empty 
sundogs

the morning sun
on grandma's grave
first butterfly

writer's block -
staring out the window
at snowflakes

Easter Sunday
the carefully trimmed beard
of the young priest

reading
the tea leaves... the gray
in her hair

the doctor wants
to take a closer look...
coffee gone cold

good news
from the cardiologist
autumn butterfly

dusting the books
I'll read when I have time
winter solstice

outside 
our bedroom window
falling sleet

dried leaves
hurry down the path
standard time

sleeping late
this autumn morning
the bed half empty

week of rain 
the henna tatoo
fading fast

crisp wind
the taste of the apple
just after picking it

on the beach
by the ancient city
sand castle ruins

rain
mixed with snow
spring equinox

Valentine's Day
we let the champagne
go flat

her head
bent over tea leaves...
how old she's grown

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine

undressing for bed
I find a hole in my sock -
the winter wind

returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love

morning prayer
the patter of rain
as I reach amen

teenagers
exchanging promises
summer's end

low tide 
a shorebird's call
rises from the mud

75 today
I walk through a puddle
because I can

her Alzheimer's
a dragonfly
goes... comes

last of his line
the year of his death
still uncarved

snow falling
on the headstones...
just and unjust wars 

petals in the wind
my neighbors practice tai-chi
in the parking lot

first firefly...
she asks me to repeat
what I just said

wrinkles in the bedsheet early dawn

first light...
after the car alarm
birdsong

second martiniâ€”
I like the way she asks me
if I twitter 

my first bite
of persimmonâ€”
a trace of Shiki

Sunday drive 
all the rain clouds
toward home

Holy Week
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

another spring
I revise
my death poem

winter break
I hope I'll be home
for the crocuses

garden Buddha
morning rain washes away
the snow

the age
I used to call old...
winter solstice

quiet Sunday
a winter fly
too slow to kill

old photo
I recognize
my father's silence

hard times
the car salesman's
missing tooth

starry night
one firefly
after another

Assisi sunset
pilgrims gather
at a gift shop

summer salad 
a nasturtium burns
the tip of my tongue

city sunset
he buys her
a rose

red light
the bus driver reads
his horoscope

flag pin
in the salesman's lapel
Memorial Day

the soft patter
of a computer keyboard
midnight solitude

main street
a red pick-up cruises
the spring rain

traffic jam
a flight of geese
across the highway

first light
an unknown bird
sings me awake

spring equinox
opening our fortune cookies

darkened church
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

Ash Wednesday
this is the year
he'll quit

a spider web
caught in my hand
scent of rain

thin crescent...
I wonder what
she meant by that

packing up the creche
one of the wise men
is missing

cold moon
a carriage horse trots
up Sixth

cold moon
the glitter of city lights 
in the river

thin crescent
she closes
the curtains

whistling kettle
snowflakes
in the wind

cold rain
lavender neon surrounds
a sex shop window

twentyfourseven
an empty laundromat
at dawn

overtime...
through an office window
the harvest moon

a night of fireflies
and cricket song...
the end of summer

a damp evening 
each of us with
our own cloud of gnats

rain on the lake
turning down
the volume

where do I
put the accent 
Hiroshima

brookside
whales are roaring
in a poem I read

sudden shower
cursing the umbrella
he left at home

outside the wall
around the cemetery
long grass

mother's day
something sexy
for his wife

war news
I wash the ink
from my fingers

rainy night
a light in
the bookstore window

wiping his eyes 
before the lights come up-
sad movie

winter sunset
shadows of branches
climb the fire escape

wildfire haze
between the icebergs 
the blue wind

January walk
Santa Claus and a flag
in a neighbor's window

my friend's ashes
heavier than I expected
winter wind

home for a visit
the sound of rain
on the river

low mass
the old priest believes
more than he remembers

new year's party
the divorced couple
leaves together

undulation
of a faded flag
autumn afternoon

midwinter
the coffee drinker
sips tea

morning rush
reading Walden
on the subway

election day
revising the poem
one more time

fog moving in
another phone call
unreturned

dandelions 
I lose sight of
the yellow butterfly

summer rain
my umbrella
stays closed

early summer
old women in the shade
of the bus shelter

a boy and his dad
playing catch out back...
long shadows

main street-
ribbons that used to be
yellow

terminal... 
his favorite ice cream 
melts in the cup

spring morning
those young men have noticed 
what she's not wearing

old western 
black hats white hats 
in shades of gray

spring rain
a man standing outside
the bus shelter

snowflakes
a robin's flight
from tree to tree

serving coffee
she asks if I take cream
the curve of her wrist

someone whistling
Blue Moon at the falls 
the mist

waiting for you
at the sidewalk cafe
half moon

chemotherapy-
she always liked the way
I kissed her hair

undulation
of a faded flag-
autumn afternoon

streetlight
my shadow growing
fading

rainy day
they give me back
my shoelaces

storm clouds -
the roofer talks about
overtime

nearly eighty -
opening
a jar of preserves

long after
the funeral service
- the unspoken words

dusk-
an unfinished sweater
on the rocking chair

sleepless night -
the whistle of a distant train
going  where?

Minnesota cold
even motorcycles
hibernate

lenghtening days 
a bird's shadow crosses
the yellow wall

last straw rejection 
the telemarketer tells me
I'm too old

a gloomy sunday
I sip my wine
and watch the rain
once on such a day
it was the time for love

poetry meeting
I try to read my haiku...
a frog in my throat

here and there
breaking through the dusk's mist
bright lights

voices of loons
cross the misted cove
call and response

A red berry falls
Staining the snow 
A silent sunset.

This dark night
Only white spots move
On the calico cat.

spring thaw
water from the fridge drips
onto the floor

Post Office 
stamped on the sidewalk
pink blossoms

wooden Buddha
with a cracked head on display
no buyers

new moon 
lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out sign

a new month - 
different seeds 
on the spaniel's ears 

ah these short nights
hardly time to see
seeds up

last day of the year
a leaf in the wind over a long
stem

a procession
the funeral of thirty one
December 2004

snowflake
without a word, the woman
gagged

the printer spits
Millennium phoenix
another sheet

blue iris
she watches the needle
penetrate his flesh

hibiscus
under the eaves
frost burned petals

the fish lazily surface
in the pond nearby 
the sun on my teacup

dream catcher
the shifting colours
of rain

moss growing
on the manhole cover 
winter rain

wild wind
on dry sedge
what more on her mind? 

oak stump-
i remember the hornets
last summer

apple core
how to bottle
memories

though touch-less
the intimate rustle of silk 

first dawn alone-
the widow eats his half
of the orange

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

lunar eclipse-
his eyes on her frayed
jeans front 

petal gust-
the street flutist's
scrambled notes 

blue dawn?
the rain's last phrase
on a glass pane

red lobster-
her prying glance
through the mist

news of his death 
I can't stop looking
at the sickle moon

mixing bowls-
the shallow echoes
of bells 

winter solstice
the widow tightens
her braids

candle drippings
on the epitaph-
a broken word

granite wall
a cold touch so hard
to resist

mountain wind
the echo of a cuckoo's
cough louder

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp

pine strand
flailing in night sky-
the first low star

twilight rain
the blue heron mid-lake
somehow smaller

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

daybreak -
ice between
the river stones

opaque windows 
barring the dawn 
of the new year

even seagulls 
imitate the stones 
first frost

the sound of foam
withdrawing from the shore
our unsaid goodbyes

winter trees
waiting on the silence
our breaths

full moon
he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand

somehow
our shrinking shadows touch
harvest moon

words
we've left unsaid-
Indian summer

crocus buds
secrets we've kept
from each other

cherry blossoms
shedding in the moonlight
the Milky Way

winter sky
the white cat's eyes
bluer

locking it -
moonlight at the back
of the mailbox

the coming of summer-
all the petals
i brushed off my hair

gray spring dawn-
the shiver of daffodils
in my bones

this cold-
Sakura cherry blossoms
on my window

this sunless spring day
chickadees chatter on-
my indecisions

watching rain
drum beat on window pane
the deaf cat

spring fever
shoots among the lilies
she can't name

mirror-
she sees her flaws
in his eyes

mirror
her mother's lips
pursing like hers

between her
and his goodbye-
sudden hail

from haiku scribblings
to a prayer
on a giant wave

silence -
the evening snow falls
onto moss

secrets
burrowing in sand dunes
a pale sunlight

left out in the rain
her old haiku
on cherry blossoms

late winter walk-
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts

in the mist
waiting to meet you-
budding crocus

frosted dawn-
his words hang
over coffee

deep winter
nothing much to say
even among crows

on street -
a shower of petals
for no one

first frost
the last of the roses
have lost their names

girl in Sunday dress
in her father's shadow
lost too soon

day after Christmas-
crows waddling to bus stop
no one awaits

distant thunder-
a caterpillar drops
from a ragged leaf

blizzard-
the slanting lines, piercing lines
our locked hands 

first frost
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers

white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call

turning
one leaf at a time-
entries for memorials 

autumn sunset
breaches rain-swept horizon-
as embers sizzle

picking autumn leaves
off the grass, her grave
nothing but fine rain

pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku

on an evening trail
of red dragonflies swarming
in a pool, stars 

leaves crackling-
in her grave tiny hands sweep
leavings of sparrows 

swarm of tiny wings
fades out in the autumn sky-
unfinished journal 

first light
the perfect symmetry
of a moth

white moonlight
seeps into my sadness-
into a mulch bed

grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles

maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain-
i reply to summer mail

folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn
this chilly morning

dawn by the river-
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon

crow browsing grass
steps on camellia blossom-
fractured silence

cloudy day
my thoughts stuck
on a spider web

concentration camp
winter branches touch
the statue's shoulders

stripping off
her sweatshirt 
sparks in the dark

valentine's day
only rain
on the scarecrow

noon 
the morning clouds
roll from the valley

aged painter 
trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush

tailgating trucker
is that load bound for K-Mart
worth more than my life?

This road
no one goes down it
autumn evening

Natural rhythms
moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green

Seven miles per gallon
Bush thanks you for 
supporting the Iraq war

My Ford Explorer
on a never-ending quest
for a parking spot

Cochrane Alberta 
Coyotes howling in the night 
Honking, geese at dawn 

Like Custer's bugler,
you sound the charge. Remember
the Little Big Horn.

I-5 corridor
Microsofties creep to work
slowly, in nice cars

If you really love
America hang that flag 
on a bicycle

invasive species
my barber points out
my first white hairs

slowly...
a loon preens
in the mountains reflection

Atlanta traffic
easy to see why Sherman
burned this city down

a hundred streets named
peachtree - no wonder sherman
burned this city down

I saw that finger!
yes you in the Intrepid -
we shall meet again

he's a stop and go
christopher columbus in
your ford explorer

brooklyn bridge walkway
bombsquad found a stray backpack 
homeland traffic jam

keep an eye open
for food, gas and ten-year-old - 
an amber alert!

the mailbox
captive in snowdrift
a letter from war

late afternoon â€“
a wind chime softly sings
in snowy garden

autumn bonfire â€“
all my summer dreams
scatter with the smoke

growing darkness
gleam of setting sun
on Chinese Lantern

waiting...
dandelion fluff
lands on the table

the winter sun 
in the cancer ward -
a quiet old couple

old pond -
another lily
in bloom

One just sits
And blue dawn light floods
his poor house.

Soprano, clear and cool,
and pale violin float
Above the freeway noise.

chemo patient
seeking inspiration
in a bookstore

November  
her nipple ring cools

pumpkin moon:
tai chi movements time
the eclipse photos

frost
on the pumpkin:
lunar eclipse

earthquake
with the typhoon  more coins
at the temple

Memorial Day 
a shadow for each
white cross

a twilight sun
between two peaks -
white lilacs

spring moonset 
a rice ball for
breakfast

in the grasses
crickets calling
the full moon

Eating alone 
The sound of cold milk
Into a glass.

in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam

hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news

winter bleak
under the rail bridge
graffiti blooms

left padlocked
under streetlight
orion's bike 

past the pleiades the silent flight of many white birds

christmas lights...
high above the street a skein
of twilight geese

in the walled garden
the scent
of decaying apples

boardwalking
the dragonfly's shadow
drops through a crack

another day
another apple crumble
... autumn deepens 

Heavy the heads of darkened sunflowers, I wonder, how long do I have

autumn days
the weight of my life's
unpicked apples

hindsight
a field of
cut stalks

tree burl
summer reveals
my old scars

our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond

wind chime
my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot

fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener

double espresso, the wail of sirens on a sultry night

i wait for the weather forecast, wiping sunflower pollen from the windowsill

water lilys
a leaping fish
catches the light

in the depths
of her sunglasses
blue sky  some
passing clouds

leaning over the fence our late neighbour's rose

solstice day
park grass pale
where the fairground
rides had been

two swans
the progress
of twilight
along the river

forget-me-nots
our white dog shakes off
pale blue stars 

remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze

day break
half a pale blue
egg shell 

good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear

how high into
the hillside cemetery
the fog tide rolls 

Holes in the cloud. A shade of blue I've never seen

flashing against
the winter killed grass
a swan's whiteness

Exposed roots.
The tree outside her
childhood home

Punctuation.
A rose petal falls
from the vase

One week later
fewer roses in
a slenderer vase

no bag we wrap the leeks in the obituary page

all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine

unsuspected metastasis moss on the roof tiles

hard frost all the new benches graffiti-tagged in silver

work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels

faltering resolutions the roof gutters still full of last year's leaves

the window cleaner's ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet

April -
a gull's cry passing
through morning snow

rattling white in my eye socket a half moon and two aspirin 

Oh, a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles

Moss on the roof
tiles. First one cat
then another

i go to bed you stay downstairs
the windscreens ice over

year's end
there's a hearse
in the fast lane

geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed

double whisky
everything glistens
in the mist

overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen

wind chime
a text brings news
of his death

frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight

spring evening
a long pause on the bridge
to watch the water run

glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard

roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn

in the hedge
the lighted windows
of a train

in dark river water, shapes of things from the human world

somewhere beyond our chilli pepper plant the red dragonfly's home

even after 30 years
the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night

into the space between thoughts falling rose petals

monday morning
ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose

full moon
a pear hanging
this side of the wall

starless night
the cyclist
without lights

sunny afternoon
the scent of leaf mold
mixed in the ice

hawk, on a fence post.
first light,
the rain a kind of mist.

day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier

muggy night opening another window to let in more insects

sunglassesheadphones  the world beyond

a blue-black feather glistens with rain another unexplained bruise

high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog

grey skies our late neighbour's pink roses reach over the fence

not long till sundown
into the willows
a yellow frisb e e 

sunlight in the snail trails my glittering career

another cloudy night
i google
the moon phase

water changing
into ice 
the pale moon

sunless days
the world locked in
a pine cone

easter sunset
a red-tinged cross
of contrails

neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber

plum blossom
the haiku poet's mind...
elsewhere

spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag
puffs out its chest

in the grey of relentless rain 
his shaved cranium and huge red headphones

on the brickwork graffiti, and marks that say ivy was here

new moon i hear about it first via twitter

red tulips in the vase on TV another cosy murder show

winter solstice
inside the hollow tree
fire blackened

Zen garden
after each storm
a clean slate

hazy afternoon
the woodpecker's call
bounces off the ice

her skin flickers in television light rain on the window

the proper word for brackets escapes me crescent moon

a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers
this life in exile

hard frost -
deep in my coat pocket
summer sea-glass

that same music
again and again
winter rain

the graveyard
our icy shortcut
through the winter fog

icebleak
no colour but the rail bridge
graffiti

still life -
at the lake's edge a tree's reflection
caught in the ice

november sun -
leaning on the old stone wall
a shadow tree

winter solstice
the pink tongue of a cat
lapping at snowmelt

dusky clouds 
a patch of blue
hangs over the valley

demi-lune
la glace craque
sous les pas

war memorial
snow has almost covered
the poppy wreaths

antique store window
looking at dirty street snow
through colored bottles

cold attic -
faded cigar box
filled with seashells

windless day
the prolific weeds
at the grave site

mushiatsui asa
te ga kimi o

egret stands
in the blue rice field,
dusk creeps in

long centipede
on the ceiling- long talks
of what to do

February 
the heart-shaped tracks
of a moose

white clouds drift
in the August sky,
a child dreams

tan lines
and coconut oil
high tide

restless night
the morning starts
without me

familiar names-
the warmth of a woodstove
in January

fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon...
shades of easter egg

A lull in the storm 
the woodpecker darts
to another tree.

The thyme
has gone to seed 
summer's end.

things come and go 
raindrops
on the pine

my stone Buddha
sits in the dark 
snow, snow, snow

cherry petals
flying higher and higher -
storm in my valley

returning birds 
three notes pass through
morning fog

a cup of tea
and a koan to go -
my cold morning

severe frost -
the sparkling whiteness
of my brown roof

autumn deepens -
I wonder what my neighbour
is writing today?!

voices of autumn -
the patter of raindrops
on my rooftiles

first cicada -
the hot day seems
even hotter

red poppy dolls
sit alone by the beach -
dead children of Tohoku 

politicians play
the same old games -
long rainy season

late spring -
the old kettle
still shines

earthquake night -
the stars are as silent
as ever

table 4 2
- a romance reduced
to numbers

scent of rain
all the ways
we failed each other

cold sunshine -
the icicles refuse
to melt

cold night -
the deeper levels of dreams
and fears

when celsius
and farenheit meet -
cold night

New Year's morning -
I wipe some dirt
from my glasses

blizzard -
the heavy weight
of snowflakes

menopause -
she even quarrels with
the autumn moon

fighting
the summer heat -
no time for poetry

the future
deep in the tea leaves...
spring growth

first firefly -
the moon also shows
his face

spring rain
the dogwood
half petals, half leaves

wisteria blossoms...
the faint memories
of grandmother's lace 

daybreak - - 
light and shadow 
on the apricot blossoms

how black!
dirt on the last patch
of snow

rainy day -
I finally finished
the Spring Saijiki

computer crash...
I wish I were
this butterfly

my daily bread
on the empty table...
spring equinox

old plum tree in bossom...
last year the old owner
died

moonlight
on the temple roof -
and silence

autumn equinox -
all the crows celebrating
with grave offerings

the dance of
echoes inside a crypt...
winter chill

hunger moon
how bittersweet
this longing

dinner outside...
the crumbs walk along
the brick wall

a tiny world
unfolds and thrives -
summer rain

the backyard
of a poor man's home...
summer heat

more rain -
lavender leans
on the stone Buddha

no fireflies...
moonlight reflects
on camellia leaves

first firefly...
a quiet night and then
lightning

powlonia blossoms -
a haiku floating
in the sky

a centipede
takes its morning walk...
aah, my kitchen table

winter,s end...
my warm socks
with big holes

spring sunshine
on the cat's belly...
mountain hermitage

a fallen leaf
brushes the corner
of your grave stone

late snow ..
a pheasant calls
in the morning mist

Ides of March...
anyone remembers
the history teacher?

spring blossoms...
the old farmer
coughs blood

winter sunset -
half of my Buddha
still in the light

remembering you -
the sparkle of the last
icicle

shadow

in the world of men
voices of insects

these tiny pink flowers
on my wildest weeds

autumn chill
the fallen leaf's veins
tinged a deeper hue

in the shade
of the full moon...
distant fireworks

on the barbeque

looking for fireflies...
I almost miss
the dramatic night sky

meditating
on a rainy day...
new green tea

in deep silence

ticking

in the cherry blossom

keeps watch

so many coincidences
in my life

now a cloud
in my sky

to an incense stick

misty clouds

despite
the foreclosure sign
daffodills

by thick fog

just staring
at some autumn clouds 
a hot cup of tea

white roads
leading nowhere 
Happy New Year?

an old temple
amongst cedar trees
too many leaves fallen...

freezing rain
the words
I cannot take back

forgetting my words
step by step
the autumn night deepens

aiming noisily 
the sound of one hand

of your kiss

continues

standing alone
under a double
rainbow

of cologne

for crickets

shines on us both 
these cold sheets

shaking on a branch
late migrators

a family of raccoons
empties the goldfish pond

campfire embers
one firefly
lights our tent

twilight
in the Chinese lantern
a glowworm

first snow
all the shades
of white

sleepless night
a square of moonlight
crosses the room

foggy glasses...
   a blurry paragraph
       above the bath water

new year's day...
     spent bottle-rockets
           in the road

wolf prints...
  the gas lantern
     splutters

novocain prick
the warmth where
the dental nurse leans

the smell
of many campfires
in this old hunting shirt

cinco de mayo
horses roll
in the shallows

 vanishing difference...
   gliding geese settle onto
        their reflections

folding chair
the newborn colt tries
to stand

damp straw...
   the day-old colt mesmerized
       by the radio

solstice
sipping a stronger brew
in the waning light

prying
   at the window...
       wind

silhouette...
  a shining snow path to
     a pale moon

hillside thunder
barely a rainbow in a plume
of smoke

morning camp
only an ember remains
but it's enough

storm warnings...
sunday afternoon by the fire
mail from an old friend

leftover summer grass
... horses browse
through crusted snow

old leather saddle
cherry colored and shiny
smells of horse

Windy Day
on the village walls
of leaves shadows

did you leave
and the day seems
getting colder

the night
in silence silence
It becomes dark

year-end bank statement
reusing the tea bag
for a second cup

the sky and I
silent exchange
thoughts and stars

the house empty
the furniture only
to wait

the house empty
It fills the sound
rain

on the wall
in the light stripe
the shadow of a flight

He arrives in the evening
the flight of a seagull
cuts through the silence

laurel hedge
submerged by waste
glory in decay

from my dreams
in the middle of the night
come rumors

Roman night
stuck in a traffic jam
under the moon

hail and rain
a frost crust
suffocates the fields

awake at night
a stone in the pond
moonlight splashes

desert landscape
rain will come and the water...
remembers each path

winter night
the chill of moonlight
on my skin

night rain
He befriends His sound
sick

the end of the day
the florist unsold
chrysanthemums

the house empty
It opens and closes the shutters
Windy Day

party's over
by unlit candles
smoking rooms

night watch
in the eyes sheperds
a flock of stars

Also on flowers
after the funeral
cove
the darkness

the first snow
enclosed between the petals
Chrysanthemum

the house empty
the rain has erased
all imprints

empty place
It makes the darkest darkness
autumn night

gust of wind
clipped on the wall
by a brush

rain turns to sleet
grounding my daughter
our shared tears

rainy evening
mountains fading
gray on gray

the old calendar
enclosed in a red circle
my birth

in the pans
carved into the rock
floats a cricket

sunny day
salt on the facade
the shadow of the smoke

a new year
Garden in the snow
still intact

the snow falls
on the branch sparrows
ever closer

the asylum
over the empty bed
scratch moon

return home
on the trail walls
but not the history

sky clouds
the church spire
so still

He runs the night
on wings of moth
toward the light

winter in the wind
No cake for this candle lit
in memoriam

cut palm
there are only
few fireflies

on the calendar
mark red circles
my path

minds lost
in their memory
naked trees

olive wood
the oil path
in his veins

roasted coffee
the smell woke
all the way

Roman villa
opens its door
over the empty

Temple of Vesta
over his fire off
rain falls

early morning
few flakes of snow
the basil

city â€‹â€‹at night
smell the rain
roasted chestnuts

clear sky
the river current
drag star

all saints day
from the corner of my eye
someone no one

moon in half
halfway open book
on the table

including butts
and cars in the parking
a yellow flower

among the magnolias
The Folia Corelli
in a violin

ripe wheat -
my hair is
Autumn leaves

ripe corn -
my hair is
Autumn leaves

moon cut
each month your breasts
reconstructed

in the twilight
two chairs in interview
even if empty

light snow -
the hammer of a woodpecker
in the silence

airport
someone deleted
the passengers

first year
the shadow of calicantus
on the calendar

at the cemetery
increase every year
my stops

cold rain
a maple leaf floats
in the water basin

the empty nest
He has filled the grass
gutter

Etruscan wall
Painted by the passage
a snail

moonlit night
the shade of a flowering peach tree
over the wall

on the sidewalk
wet from the rain
Walking trails in the sky

broken necklace
in each pearl spread
a bit 'of Heaven

evening of June
the door ajar
only the dark

closed garden
passes the wall perfume
oranges

bend in the river
where the little girl drowned
papyrus in bloom

on the sidewalk
among the cyclamens
one man

Easter Vigil
mother sits next
the empty bed

deep autumn
we read love poems once
in these woods

after the rain
the baby's grave
It reflects the sky

on the sidewalk
a written love
and many steps

crescent moon
a new path
to scatter seeds

windy night
look at the sick man
last leaves

Egyptian lions
in autumn light
watching the sun

deserted house
It looks out the window
full moon

breaks thoughts
the tip of the cypress
shaken by the wind

daisies in
vase next to bread
hot from the oven

on the hill
ruins of a castle
and apple trees in blossom

after the rain
the nearly full moon
lose color

October moon
white pumpkins glow
in the field

rain falls
the Roman aqueduct
found water

suddenly
a piano while
the moon rises

headstones
narrow to each other
autumn wind

time passes
the graves in the cemetery
you are old

mown field
long lines of stems
nameless

stone staircase
on the steps footprints
of men and Rain

amid the myrtle
carved in granite
door to nowhere

the wind carries
scent of mimosa
between the antennas

from year to year
grow old with the trunk
heart engraved

Cerveteri: Etruscan necropolis.
Cerveteri: Etruscan necropolis.

Autumn arrives early
for this mountain ridge
and me

also tonight
snow gondola
the Grand Canal

blanket of snow -
It is also masked
the beggar

red spots...
only poppies
in the green grass

in the twilight
flights of cormorants
and lapping of waves

on the hill
flock of scattered houses
without a shepherd

homeless man dead
season pass
in the trash

Â summer lightning
reveal in the night
the hidden streets

foggy road
after the corner I find
a closed wall

Country cemetery
snail on corroded tombstone
trails from A to O...

Ancient roman ruins
along both sides of the road
white jet trail above...

autumn mist
bull elk's mating call
splits the silence

Sky dewed with stars
cool air listening in news
a man was hanged.

sundown
summer evening melts in dark
fragrance of tea

misty summer rain
calling pheasant
in Zen temple

a wild violet
on the sunny hill
noon time nap

Spring equinox
Pray the ancestor grave
In cold rain

kirinoyoni amaikaorino shirokiume

autumn rain 
refinery lights remind me
of Christmas

topless,
the skyscraper
in rain mist

fading light -
the stone steps brighter
than the foliage

raining
last night's baked chicken
tonight's curried soup

first frost
instead of silk
flannel

monsoon-
on the window a leech climbs
the himalayas

white morning
far there hospitals
bombarded

the slide gently
in the flesh of the mango
sunset

cold winter
person on the way
which leads to the pond

first frost
its pot mint sprig
remade its roots

night of Epiphany
this strange dream flew
at first light

evening light
towels on the rope
remouillent

return trip
Slowly the sky and the waters
merge

night
in the hallway my steps
guided by the moon

almost midnight
Santa plastic
deflates

heavy rain
the old rubber boots
not tall enough

autumn equinox
the fallen leaf
half-green, half-gold

first wind turbines
Slowly they evacuate
a radical of the night

Christmas market
Alsatian sauerkraut
on the Brittany stand

showering yet
three in chestnut jays
brighten the day

sleepless night
I gather the petals
wilted roses

All Saints Day
from my window
backwaters

time of Gift Giving
near the old computer
a new mouse

empty pockets
the eye turned towards the moon
nearly full

All night long
Rain on the glass
sheep head full

rising moon
her smooth belly
like a pebble

in the fog
the neck of a goose
winter hour

morning tea
returning the cup
icts emptiness

Toussaint
the family circle widens
under the marble

risk of fusion -
on my fingers the smell
sea â€‹â€‹immortal

earthen
from terrace to terrace
the muezzin's call

stormy weather -
under the boots noise
pavers

low sky
we saw branches
somewhere

shimmers
scarecrow shaken
its CD

Pentecost
the flame
in his eyes

crossroads
as Christ on the Cross
purple nettles

shorter days
she covers her face
wrinkle cream

eight days

fat autumn
at least the tea
remains green

the thigh of Bergerac
on the tongue

under the veil of wintering
the ladybug
curled up

the girl has three suns
in the sky

first day of the year
between cheese and coffee
change the world

a nail to fix
the star

first cold
a summer haiku
in the pocket base

fog
erases nothing

night

at the corner of walking

this steady rain
the one thing I needed
you couldn't do:
to love me
without stint

the wind blows stronger
return

dark night
in a moon rai
crazy butterfly

midday
the dunes of the eye feels
stronger

mild spring
wild geese gather
noiseless

agadirs
Women dressed in dark
stony silence

wool wedding
the first moth
in the closet

meteor watching
a match lights up
year unknown face

end of summer
more cucumbers
than neighbors

beginning of winter
the snow piled high
on the lawn chairs

graded papers
suddenly the rosebush
blooming

void encroaches
as vision vanishes:
glaucoma wins

homeless shelter
an unkempt man peels
a dyed egg

rainstorm
ants drink
from a droplet

end of day
it closes the henhouse
between dog and wolf

stormy night
the excitement of water
in the kettle

damselflies
dart across the water
a bluer blue

in the breath of the surf
unnecessary words

starry Night
happiness can
pissing in the moonlight

all under his feet
a sheet chiffonnade
the smell of life

autumn evening
the spider as dormant
on the Web

Time change
the neighbor's gate
whines earlier

banks of marshes
in that old willow autumn
has left a nest

All night long
they roam the sidewalks
dead leaves

weather alert
behind the closed shutters
a snail

August heat
pregnancy test results the
Become clear

first cold
on the pull of the past year
cat hair

end of season
the horn of the baker
earlier and earlier

starry Night
the Great Bear hangs
neighbor of the antenna

rainstorm
body smell
in the bus

cloudy sky
this full moon night
on the calendar

beautiful skies
Gaza setting drape
deadly beauty

bouquets of explosions
under each fumarole
invisible flesh

the bubble bursts
making dance the moon -
old mare.

about her divorce
and his cactus

autumn morning
the smell of fresh rain
in my coffee

the old tabby
refuses to come in

north winds â€“
snow flakes and
the smell of smoke

Orange sunrise peaks through
The tubes and wires of father's
Life support machine

late rising moon
fireflies decorate
the tamarind tree

moving day
my life
reduced to boxes

Autumn night 
Puddles by the wayside
filling with the stars

Cautiously the cat with each step measuring
the depth of the snow.

the scent of evergreens
slowly spreading

under the oak
blue feathers
black cat

thunder storm
on the sidewalk
earthworm slick


sudden thunderstorm-
open umbrellas flower
in many colors

night breeze
carries a moth
to the moon

lonely butterfly
in the quiet morning light
where are you going?

quiet dawn-
in the oak tree
mourning doves

Indian summer
turkey feather falling
just out of reach

the taste
of pine's bitter honey
these bitter tears

Tropical storm warning
Wet sand in our kisses
The opening sky

first time
your curly hair
tickled my thighs

tornado
in the wreckage
a bird sings

Walking
quiet thunder
spring rain 

Balloon floats
Over garbage truck
Party is over

a butterfly
over the bouquets...
I tune out the speaker

sunny day
a wasp tastes
everyone's beer

spring frost 
the park cannon aimed
at the church

Brittle scent
of a summer storm
lightning's sillage

senior's home
we celebrate the new year
a 7:00 pm

heavy rain
my flower seeds sprout
in the neighbor's yard

from a photo negative
reunion

roadside rest stop
he adds a haiku
to the graffiti

dull pencil
the staff meeting goes
on and on

A snowy footbridge
the sound of water
under the ice.

veils our praying hands...

fills with stars

offshoring jobs...

in every direction 

sudden cold -
she reads and rereads a book
jams

stuck with a clove

faded postcard
the Nagasaki temple
Then

luxury watches
affordable

seeking a female

Parent-party eve of
its most beautiful sweater
eaten by moths

between 2 sardines
she speaks
his pilgrimage

summer heat
kimono hung on the wall
billows from the fan

72 years
she never saw her vagina
winter sun

I put on my socks
she talks to me
of carbohydrates

yet night-
alone in the kitchen
it breaks nuts

night Ã©meutes-
after the small dej
the crumbs

Intifada-
a portable to another
rabies

Intifada-
one side ties
the other Nike

Intifada-
a slight delay
for dinner

after removal
the same coat racks

Judas trees in flower-
mist and fog
the papacy

afternoon heat

Before leaving
scatter the coals -
flight of fireflies

Shadows of entants
a fire to another-
starry sky

Just before winter
Buddha junk
his last gift

A snail
in the right eye of the citrouille-
next Halloween

On the washing line
a bird in Ã©quilibre-
somewhere in Falluja

silver dawn
slug traces iridesce
on the garden path

The clicking of the shears
in the branches of oranger-
the forecast cold

Mosquitoes
in my new house
did not follow me

Summer Storm
the small cloth of my neighbor
well hung

After the rain -
beer capsules
by the roadside

late winter-
chive seeds
in the palm of my hand

Late summer
the greyness of dusk
without fireflies.

Herding sheep
the prickly smell
of wet wool.

Corsican polyphony

on snow
a small blue garbage bag
color of the sky

Rain on a flat tin roof. Hammers without nails

all I need are mountains
and a hedgehog -
autumn deepens

this winter's day the garbage cans evanesce

winter solstice
the Persian cat's half-
closed eyes

small town cafe
only strangers
get menus

To the Finland Station
They rush
to strike a deal for iPhones

the metallic tang of deer's blood
Dominates the forest

cat's paws crawling
across a lake's surface area
silent morning

Croton hedges
Their fall foliage with false
South Florida in autumn

a pale moon
Reveals the crime

Red fall foliage
the Sun at noon
glorious

They share
a bruised apple
moonlit feast for two

Harvest moon
too much light
for field mice

summer rains gone
the river
finds icts own channel

His name
on the black granite wall
and we must ask, why?

partner after the argument only the snapping of pole beans

hellebore bloom That spring morning as tanks rumble

rumble of thunder
rouses dawn
late summer in Miami

His ash covers school desk
all the remains
8:17 am Hiroshima, local time

brush in hand
Carefully he...
8:16, local time, Hiroshima

in a pile of rubble
faint peeps are Heard
Rats, of course

ebb tide's retreat
and I grow older
recessionals

tang of salt spray
at a fishing pier
late summer

lighting the way
with a jar of fireflies
last summer's childhood

in the evening coolness
of a verandah
Reflect hereyes stars

after-night long
the singing of birds
at dawn

wisp of clouds
the slow spiral of debt
in my espresso

Gazing at the moon
it was still summer's evening
feast for mosquitoes

clouds gather
in a darkening sky
a walk interrupted

a careful sip
of chickpea more than coffee
His breakfast brew

croaking of frogs
just after-dawn
summer memories

silk from a web
entangled in my hair
a homeless spider

before dawn
By the small pond
The sound of crickets

chamomile petals
swimming in rainwater
for her blond highlights

Splat!
a windshield and a bug
find Each Other

polished granite
Reflects my face off
my father's grave

cold rain
sharp as nails
late afternoon

Almost dusk -
the zigzag flight
of linked dragonflies

El Hueso's dry bones
still wrapped in a uniform
That he so disgraced.

old, brittle, dry bones
found inside a uniform
a past imperfect

childhood's summer gift
That first dandelion
dancing on the wind

My tea gets colder
and the madeleine just sinks
memory Betrays

a cooing is Heard
from a small puff of feathers
Reviews another dawn

small green waves crashing
contre has porcelain rim
morning tea tempest

in an old snapshot
His Irish smile still flashes
her slight, shy smile, too

faces from the past
Their memories in old pictures
effaced by the flood

red poppies growing
entre rows of white tombstones
as in remembrance

under a full moon
a homeless man gathers cans
urban harvest

waiting
for my illness to end
November rain
seeps slowly, slowly
into the ground

deep into the night
a dog's sharp bark
Becomes gunfire

butterfly wings
Their so loud flapping
in a temple's Silence

sharp smell
after-noon downpour has
electric summer

rows of white markers
all at Attention
Memorial Day

late morning breakfast
left uneaten
too much of spring

Just a small basketball
filled with hidden treasures
she proudly caries

a yellowed clipping
falls out from her Bible
Emmett Till's obit

In front of bronze doors
They huddle Against the Cold
the newly homeless

early morning dew
was bronze temple bell
just before ringing

clear lake enclosed
Entirely Within
a bowl of miso

my body
aching and feverish
after-nightfall
the autumn wind rises

breakfast still rumbles
but no guns are --other Heard
Armistice morning.

he winds up His watch
n Carefully That morning
That will end the war

The bugler plays "Tap"
her face so serious
her parents, so proud

Ordinary morning
bluest of skies, crisp, clear air
up to the shadows

Mid morning coffee
sipped from a chipped mug old
so comforting

Rainbows reflected
in So Many potholes
afternoon rainstorm

That spring day
the flowers-have long faded
yet we remember

Reflects the mirror
a face I know so well
dad's

a flagpole stands guard
before has flooded schoolhouse
as a river runs

perched on a guardrail
of a busy highway
year egret preens

three days
of cold autumn rain
a dull ache
settles deep
inside my breasts

Cracks on a sidewalk
Lost Among the grass and weeds
urban spring

Cracked head statue
of the Buddha a reminder
everything passes.

one plus one = 3
a happy couple expecting
Their first child

Fountain pen ink spill
not contained by a blotter
Mare Crisium

she cries silently
her sobs barely audible
and no one to hear

rivulets of red
running down her pale young face
she clutches a doll

he turns one last time
His sailor's flashing wry smile
That bright November.

the War on Horror
G.I.'s on hashish kill
Afghans for sports

I turn off the pumpkin lights
a predawn
harvest moon

white roadside crosses
Where the road meets Nature's swale
memento mori

Sentinels of spring...
kites bobbing for care
saucy winds in March

Gleaners harvest moon
pale faces, leaden eyes stare
at an empty field

glassy-eyed, gutted
catch of the day we shaved ice
at the fish market

Neither white nor black
a yellow smog That will not lift
Alzheimer's pall

Full Corn Moon
time to gather the harvest
before leaves fall

charred goat bones
They say without conviction
Somali nightmares

too hot for miso!
he pushes it aside
That August morning

wildflower bouquet
we left country highway
the endless road

Carefully tea leaves
saved, dried, and used again
hidden poverty

there's a pelican
Â en ce que ball of feathers, tar
or it is a gull?

beneath the fireworks
endless bullfrogs

the crowd
holding blossoms...
thunder!

Among new lilies
she waters the stone
Buddha

white clouds
glide Safely
over mine fields

homesick-
sundown just behind
the fence

spitting seeds
into a blue Sky-
the old elm

Forgetting to ask
for the seniors' rate-
falling leaves

just over the fence
a constellation of stars
trucks and

wildflowers
along my neighbor's wall
soften her voice

unexpected guest-
a thought out cam
of nowhere

smell of rain
young deer run
Across the field

winter rain
Where the sheets she slept
grow colder

sifting shadows
with remnants
of rain

desert sand...
my sleeping bag under
a full moon

giant moon...
the bark of a dog echoes
over the fence

crystalline sky
the pioneers left no clue
qui trail to take

willow scent
hangs a kingfisher
in the air

desert heat-
smilies along the narrow road
to the deep north

spring trek
a rusted snowplow
at roads' end

sweet basil
dried snail tracks crisscross
the window box

Arizona
road rest stop, the dog sniffs
yellow snow

a moth flutters
over the candle flame...
damned fool

still water...
the undercurrent
in her voice

storm warning...
a street corner argument
Many turns heads

falling stars
from the sky...
autumn moon

November winds
the dog finds dead birds
in the hedge

desert cemetery-
my sister in law
Does not weep

summer ends-
her pale freckles
in dark tan

highway fog-
the honking of geese
homeward bound

desert wind-
iron and copper flavor
in my coffee

spring day-
the wall clock
still winter

appalachian spring-
carbide carbuncles
in the coal oil light

moon hare-
bloody gloves lay
on the ice

frosty dawn-
the dog watches me
pack my bag

campfire coffee...
condor wings glean
the first rays of sun

making pancakes
between whispers...
morning mist

arctic air
soothes the desert heat...
blended whiskey

slate skys
chalk mark outlines
on the sidewalk

peach moon...
the thin slice left
for us

grassy moon
we slip off our shoes
to count the stars

garden embrace
the fresh smell of her
sun dried laundry

kitchen embrace
the smell of her hot
apple pie

farewell embrace
a faint essence
of mothballs

montana morning
the horses with their backs
to blowing snow

street light sway 
dreams of her linger
with the storm

Sack of cheeries 
clouds grow dark on the road
to the coast

humid morning...
words dangle
from her lips

salmon sunrise
a splash resounds over
the calm bay

farmer's market
she paints a flower
on a child's cheek

tandem bicycle
wind in our hair
a shared laugh

misty morning
echoes of blue jay cries
through the pines

fresh brewed coffee
cream and sugar swirls
she stirs in her thoughts

spring breeze
blowing dandelions
in circles

dry haystack
flames climb higher
against the night sky

rainy morning
the haijin stirs
sugar in his coffee

alabaster moon 
glowing among bare pine tops
in cool mountain mist

kissing her slowly
where the rain
never falls

humid night...
the darkness
between your thighs

Passover darkness -
before the buds burst open
a child's eyes in death.

desert garden
frosted lettuce leaves
in the pink dawn

old park bench
i touch our initials
each time i pass

new housing
hammer and saw replace
the dove's coo

christmas services
a cellular phone rings out
handel's messiah

no island
in the bay today
morning fog

stop sign
thru the bullet holes
ghetto moon

November fog
not a tree
to be seen.

Purple loosestrife
pale in the
lingering mist.

A cold morning
the pink of tulips
through the mist.

upstairs, swathed
in neon, the
scent of jasmine

a movement of deer
into twilight
suddenly spring

fireflies competing
with a full moon
summer solstice

the way grass parts
as the pheasant passes
spring's end

moonlessness
so many ways
I want to touch you

earth day
even the shadows at dusk
smell green

fading
right before my eyes
morning moon

light rain
on sweet, sweet clover
late summer's dusk

winter rain
the confusion in her voice
all over again

This morning the geese
have taken over the skies
in wild abandon
how sudden this stillness then
and now how I have missed you

morning moon
filling up my window
autumn's end

lanternless night...
a whisper passing
through leaves

autumn twilight
captures the mood of leaves
swirling everywhere
in this circular motion
hear the laughter of children

white cloud of a moon
drifting in the morning sky
these October days
how like a fine mist that fades
this future now so fragile

summer's end
the tenderness
of light

after loving-making
scent of wild clover
through the window

my children and I
race to see the sunset
before it fades

how tenuous time now seems
slipping away
from my reach

after the dream
the scent of approaching rain
in the dusty air

blackbird song -
the name of a daughter
i'll never know

funeral -
stuck in an antique vase
bubble

autumn rains
on the way to the old house
new banks

file -
between my car stereo
two transmitters

a slower
moon this evening...
the cold!

the last leaf -
his white breath dissolves
in the garden

Indian summer
takes the wheel
counter clockwise

summer afternoon
the boy to school window
reads the clouds

whirling
on the trampoline
cherry blossoms

kite shop -
entering with every customer
the summer breeze

spring rain
paint is peeling
the garden gnome

falling leaf -
fills the fading light
slow my room

first date
close to each other
to study the menu

sunrise
from village to village
cockcrowing

dental practice
in the waiting room a row
yellowed chairs

autumn depths...
a mole dreaming
of darkness

memories
the carbon black
on the roof tiles

museum hall
studying children
their echoes

early frost
the cold side
of the bed

December Rain...
person view
on a wall

reflection in the window
his weeping face -
thud of rain

at the end of the day
the shade of the oak cross
the village street

Asked about Le Monde
glasses upside -
how tired!

Thanksgiving Day
delicate aroma of turkey -
sky scorched from Iraq

out of the metro
face to face with the moon -
return from work

full moon
above the skyscrapers -
it's midnight

the egg seller...
her cracked hands
speak of winter

to November
trumpets of death -
five or six

Day of Thanksgiving -
bountiful harvest
bought cheaply

the rising sun -
in frosted glass
a star cluster

70 mph
the infant snores
a bit Slower

winter night
finding my pajama bottoms
on my wife

putting a cork
In last night's wine
late autumn

the glass jar
full of fireflies
bedtime

evening sky
Some counting fireflies
more than once

smell of rain -
soft ridges of mint leaves
oil my fingers

remembering summer
how brittle the leaves
underfoot

high noon...
young girls harvest
rice from a mirror

summer rain
the smell of earth
in the air

watching clouds
the white petals
of a crushed crocus

smells of spring
adrift in the morning air
bubbles under ice

after the rain
moon and stars
underfoot

my wife
home from hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

My 72nd winter
the deepening cold
in every room 

month-old obit
of an ex-girl friend
unexpected rain

back and forth
across our conversation
fireflies

death watch ended
the rain storm
begins

my wife
home from the hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

spring
a few blocks closer
than yesterday

after the storm,
an egret fording
darkness

at opposite ends
of the reading room
ex-lovers

despite my assurances
my wife's makeup
thicker

somewhere
behind the old barn
end of the rainbow

despite the day's heat
mum's tombstone
so cold

thunderstorms
all day long
broken promises

hot chocolate
the scent stronger
this cold night

late night rain
the crickets finally
silent

nothing
in our bedroom
but moonlight 

sunset traffic
slowly down the hill
into darkness

at the crossroads
no wind to give
a direction

early spring...
young women collecting
peach blossoms

smalltown street
sunset and moonrise
at opposite ends

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

home alone
the cold
of an autumn rain 

silent night
the fog thick
at every window

late night traffic
the swirl of leaves after
the last bus

deep deep deep cold
the lengthening pauses between
her words

while making love
the last icicle
falls

bad news from home
the cold morning
colder still

voices
in the cemetery
remembrance day

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

after midnight...
a shooting star beneath
the wharf

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up

pouring rain
yet another question
without an answer

graveside sermon ended
the last leaves blown from
a nearby tree

63 today
nothing from here to the horizon
but fair weather clouds

start of a new season
a book loaned
to a new friend

summer solstice    the wind still cold

right after
morning prayers
distant thunder

mountain storm
somewhere during its echo
the thunder ends

60 today
the full moon
still rising

somewhere
in the graveyard
birdsong

mid-summer...
she shares with me
a ripe melon!

also
in the fog
the scent of autumn

cold dark night
the warmth of her hand
in mine

snow and rain mixed
my angry words
and her tears

death
of an old friend
my cup empty

pelting rain
on the car radio
nothing but blues

behind the man
in the open doorway
nothing but darkness

the gap
between the mountains
filled with fog

spring breeze
between pages of an old book
a crushed rose

bedtime 
trying not to count
maimed solders

indian summer
the viagra stock
deflates

no longer a
mirror, this lake chasing
geese into darkness

late season
christmas lights illuminate
a golden buddha

Fly,
be afraid!
No Buddhists in this house!

after the fireworks... the thunder moon

huddled cows
their steam thickens
the valley mist 

for a moment
the gull in the air
is very white

leap year
looking a her twins
a squinting woman 

less cars
in front of the brothels
valentine's day 

on my smartphone
mount fuji in the sunset
morning coffee 

after the bell
just the rain on the umbrellas
ashes to ashes 

for just a moment
the warmth of our tears
cold rain

almost summer...
eating an especially
ripe mango

the evasive look
of a teen without make up
first buds

her cooled tea
in the middle of the table
first snow 

evening tram
her diamond on her nose
a star 

more piercing
in the autumn mist
the blackbird's song

asleep
a golden dot on her ear
bus forty one

emptied fountain
carried by the autumn wind
silt scent

March morning
look eastward
fukushima

cold sun
in the parliament
their screams

the silence
of the rain april
partner after the shower

Winter storm
a drop through the window
Drop by drop

Gusts of wind
dancing together under
a harvest moon

autumn sun
the footsteps of my father
slower

a darkest point
in the snow ultrasound
full autumn moon

full moon
after the pumpkin soup
more rounded belly

in the fog
My breath is lost
the evening train

on the bridge
people hurry
summer rain

snowfall
the tea bag sinks
slowly in water

in my palm
her bigger breasts
winter sun

December evening
on the ultrasound screen
as snow

twilight winter
the shadow of the scarecrow
beyond the scope

slowly
advance beetle
June storm

the fullness
of ripe melons...
this summer moon

full moon
the shadow of her breasts
lands on me

Back to School
still a bit high tide
near dunes

early March
on the dog's carcass
the first flies

low tide -
quartered in the fort
the corpse of a dog

sunset
on the fourth glass
the trace of a bird

under cassiopÃ©e
a cricket

Around the Moon
Slowly, the fog
above crickets

watch the moon
move behind the oak
Summer Wind

calm water
two swans frolic
calm water

Autumn freshness
to feed a child
eighty years

summer leaves...
remembering
mother's dry skin

Saturday morning
under the cherry tree from Japan
a pink puddle

the Great Bear
moving on water
spring rain

spring evening
because we quietly
near violets

blue night
violets
invisible

ex-girlfriend
with a baby carriage
spring rain

tonight
disrupts a moorhen
the Great Bear

first snow
a clueless teenager
died from an overdose

new Moon
nothing on the lake
the cry of the moorhen

low clouds
listen snow
sleepless night

scents of apple pie
my grandmother's kitchen
photo album

a mountain,
the stone buddha...
and cold food

haiku
written on the subway
illegible

Friday night
the office of silence
on my keyboard

partner after the fireworks
he marvels
at the moon

five am
behind the thick fog
the smell of fresh bread

in the mirror
the look of love of mother
for his daughter who recites

in the empty schoolyard
only plastic bags
are going the rounds

on the neck
the scent of her hands
drink greedily

a pen in hand
it has its drain
and I its strengths

like last year
cherry blossoms
hides buildings

open the window
and smell the white lilac
hatched tonight

first day of spring
stubborn icicles
still hang on

daybreak
your kiss on the lip
of a coffee cup

ripples in the sand
and then round in water
low tide and then high

fresh autumn breeze
or the advance of age?
forgotten tea...

moonless night
a cereus cactus opens
blooms solstice

sudden gust
carp leap from pole
to gulp the air

wind chill
beneath the monk's robe
a naked monk

screen of pine
white silent glides
we egret wings

sand through fingers
a tracery of palms
midnight blue one

silken winds
i am wrapped in quietness
of cottonwood seeds

back and forth
slowly grinding ink
the weight of my words

spring nightfall
ink melts
stone over

the full moon
and a rice field
planted with stars

fogged window
a blend of green and gray -
hot tea with milk

morning fog
dissolving cypress -
sfumato

slice of moon
the scent of jasmine spills
into thick darkness

brilliant Venus drips
from a gold crescent moon
this night as the first
the eve of thirty years
veiled in ultramarine

the rain
in the yellow landscape
September

Lobster top
with his eyes shaped buttons
fixed me

August
all singers insects
day and night

a bit of wind
on my bare shoulders
smell of morning

summer morning
even green barley field
surrounds the ruined abbey

flowers
cut early
on the pavement

moon day...
a paper lantern floating
down river

tall grass
curved with the nozzle flange
midday

vow of obedience
high curved herbs
in the harmattan

sap
flowing maple flank
frost cracks

red leaves
the first to fall
porto tonight

Zen garden
steles emerge from the sand
another dead soldier

tra i lampi
it suono della cavalletta
ancora un poco

full moon -
missing two evenings
to its roundness

her hair done
sheltered from the north wind
open grave

it prolongs
blower computer
the cricket

wait for morning
the sun at the end of the branches
Maple

kissing you
under a paper moon...
the stars!

children are
float colored lanterns
evening Hiroshima

changing winds
bring up your kite
and the Dow

summer solstice
the longest days
shorter written

spring wind
scattered the flowers of magnolia
nineteen years

in the antique shop
the bottom of the empty cabinet
the rays of the sun

bow our heads
passing under the lilac
heavy snow

the last note
before she boards the bus
cold winter morning

pass
between the shade of the maple
and the moon

nightfall
follow the war on screen
sleep without dream

last moon
before irradiation
Hiroshima

cool morning...
your smile pasted on
a coffee cup

pissing in a puddle
Droplets of moonlight
On Her sandal

indian summer
the neighbor's daughter sunbathes
Their beside empty pool

chill night
New fallen pear blossoms
glow in the moonlight

fresh cut lawn
a dozen fireflies
inspect the job

windstorm
the berry stains
on the path

amid war
and rumors of war...
Reviews another grandchild

spring cleaning
long neglected baseball cards
see the light of day

long night
the waterfall's
icy silence,

gale winds
the stone Buddha
remains centered

beautiful orange butterfly
On His shoulder lands
oblivious

a monkey Listens
a son own breath...
autumn rain

trembling
the hair ribbon falls
with inhibitions

jury duty
the clock pendulum goes
back and forth

summer breeze
someone practices drums
in the valley

no rain
the sound of crunched
grass

museum
so hot the mummy
hoodies

drops down the lily
leaf by leaf

hail storm
the golfers run
for cover

of every tree

of your goose bumps

at each station
a flowering tree

opening the saijiki
to early spring

faintly purple
Against the moon -
pines in the light

the last light of day
purple rhododendrons
dissolves in the dark

full moon
only you at my window
an empty face
DID loneliness wipe away
the last traces of passion?

irises
bluer
hers in

petals pressed
entre pages of a book
i never read

so clear

winter solstice
passing her
bends the candle's flame

bamboo depths...
in carp circles
your smile

Cup of tea
It is finally empty
smoke of incense

mist on the fields
just is glimpsed
the loose crumbling

it breaks the silence
the negra lullaby
there over the pier

after the rain
en laundry Waving
in the blue sky

under the rain
on the last step
you turned

Loaf of bread
in a puddle
bum has fishing

Night Flight
on the wings of aircraft
Moon strips

sunny day
finally on the pine
a cicada

sky clouds
only aircraft
Blows engine

through the cat

short night...
thoughts of you and
a paper thin moon

sound of footsteps
football has to a can
Silence and then

King in armor
a mantle of snow
on his shoulders

Ghetto in the morning
lined up, cold,
against the wall

in the twilight
burn the moths
lamp

like every night
the voices in the street
lilac flower

three petals fall
from the purple coneflower...
Almost Summer

her small breasts

short night
an egret standing
knee deep in mud

lakeside
the fog makes the loon's call
much more haunting

twilight
watching my shadow
float downriver

sipping more than
just tea
the moon in passing

eyeing
the apple
at buddha's feet

the farmer,
planting corn under
a pregnant moon

drunk tonight
an elixir of cherry blossoms
and moonlight

memories
floating in a tea cup
autumn moon

his shadow
passes me by
the charcoal seller

the potter's fingers
wet with clay
first rain

saying the rosary
a laborer
planting rice

rainy night
her phone number
in my wallet

river road
he stops to buy
a can of worms

cold night
the clink of bottles
in a grocery cart

contemplating
nightfall
the stone buddha

the offering
in front of the stone buddha
eaten by cats

between two rivers,
the echo of
his mallet

sunday afternoon
a steam train
pushes back the fog

eating rice
how many stars are
in the sky?

falling leaves
a trail of clothing
leads to the bed

biting his nails,
a little boy watches
the outgoing tide

cold night
my reflection
sipping coffee

moon viewing
just me and spider
tonight

the moose grunts.again.
the nylon tent walls
seem thinner

moon viewing
warming my hands
with a cup of coffee

all hallows eve
stars paint the
cemetery ground

all saints day
spent candles
in the cemetery

dark clouds
a student drawing
with charcoal

egrets
plucking shadows
at dusk

fading this
autumn night
the heron's legs

sculpting
clay, the potter
at dawn

master wind
sweeping the temple
zealously

house cleaning
the forest fire
at dawn

metal birds
fly south to the
forest fire

steady rain
she rants about her boss
all through supper

even my pee
stays inside this
cold winter night

snowfall
a milk mustache
on my daughter's face

geese honking
children in the
bathtub playing

lakeside,
below the egret
a city of lights

thousands of miles
away, her first birthday
fresh mango

swimming across
the moonlit sky
a gray carp

half moon
darkness drinking from an
alabaster teacup

floating
down river
an egret's shadow

dried wheat grass
a bleached blond
combing her hair

no stars
in the sky tonight
hungry carp

first frost warning -
she no longer
pours his coffee

burning leaves
this foggy evening
two kinds of smoke

waiting for winter
eating rice balls
under a full moon

scooping steamed rice,
the laborer
at sundown

windswept afternoon
tea scent
on my tongue

thank you, mango
for a moment i was
somewhere else

passing cars
replace sheep
this sleepless night

reoccurrence
of cancer 
no spring this year

gentle
on my window
summer rain
and his whispers rising
falling, rising...

in memory of Quentin Crisp:

season of mists...
a calling of wild geese
arrows south

afternoon card parties
the rumor mill's
farm system 

amber leaves
caught between 'for sale'
and 'sold'

again and again -
news of his wife's death

old manor house
each empty room has
its own echo

slender grasses
and warm summer rain
touching the buddha

into dusk
the white rose
still whiter

carousel music
the little girl's smile
comes round again

winter ennui... 
coming down with a slight 
touch of clouds 

a ladder leans
into the scent of apples...
orchard fog

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee 

skin mapping
the familiar constellations
on his back

recycling
old stories get a new twist
at the rumor mill

only the glow
of a paper lantern
new moon

alighting
on the edge of night
barn owl

brussel sprouts
only the bitterness left
on our table

brewing storm...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee

a touch 
of bluegrass...
spring 

the noir
of a beetle's carapace
passing rain

bobble and bounce
of the last marshmallow...
hot cocoa 

cutting flowers...
a honeybee lingers
in the empty space

the first scent 
of pink jasmine
open book

wet wooly mittens
drying by the hearth side
the smell of wet sheep

city hall scandal
the town's rumor mill
adds a third shift

the rhythmic lift
of her childbearing hips
high tide 

another way out...
a backdoor slammin'
in the wind 

Beware of Dog
only the wildest flowers
go in there

the visual feast
of the first plum blossom
hunger moon

left behind
his scent of aftershave
on my cheek 

wolf call
in the distance...
ice moon

the hollow sound
of sacred earth landing
six feet below

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to

mid April
even in the shadows
the ice melts

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight

red sky-
our boat flag frayed
by 20 summers

rumble of thunder-
slicing just-picked peaches
for the pie

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear

lingering grief-
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain

that cricket -
it's THERE
or THERE! 

avalanche warnings -
more tails of rain
and radiation 

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain

a steady drizzle-
all day the weight
of things unsaid

sleet ticking windows
the chemo drip
in its last hour

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves

midsummer morning
the boat's gentle tug
at the anchor 

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes
chilled wind

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet

winter returns
one stubborn maple still drips
ever.so.slowly

searcher's call
the lost child's name-
streetlamps veiled with rain

journey's end
far off in the blue distance
dark clouds

ice moon-
a berry branch
forced into bloom

avalanche warning-
how very still
this winter night

our dusty truck-
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green

that long-ago kiss
and still Orion strides
the winter sky

bitter cold
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food

deepening snow
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland

warmed-over coffee
the gray gray sound
of winter rain

3:00 a.m.
through sounds of winter rain
the mail plane landing

head cold -
running out of tissue
before noon

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars

sipping fresh cider
both dippers
among the far stars

cool morning
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog

meditation room
books of wisdom
lean left... and right

turning north
sand from both oceans
in little jars

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn

nearly 60 
so many mountains around me
still unclimbed

a B-52
thunders over the bay
blue heron lifting

atop the high wall...
the intertwining of
barbed wire  roses

after brief rain...
petrol rainbows appear
on the tarmac

patience.
on the dock he sits beside
a can of worms

mist and rain-
from the dark church
we walk into light

uphill country walk...
on the verge wild plants
thriving in a carrier bag 

fading light
with its own tiny rainbow
the lake's fountain

recycling point...
one bin's slot is sealed
with a spider's web

after warm rain...
by the river the scent
of garlic  earth

after the storm...
stuck to the window
two leaves side by side

five counties, then
at the horizon
Betelgeuse

concert in full flow...
mingling with the music
the smell of cooking

washing-up done-
through netted windows
a fading sunset

the silence
between us-
filled with sunlight

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors

falling leaves more of the sky

moon on the wane
the sound of wings
at dusk

desert dream
the sound of foghorns
on the Solent

ageing skin
the warmth and softness
of a baked apple

open windows -
all the contrails
feathering

spring clarity
the local pub reveals
its old name

poetry books
banished to the bathroom -
spring cleaning

solar flare -
spring moon half-hidden
in the clouds

February rain -
the word 'spring'
on the Scrabble board

February wind -
the word 'crocus'
on the Scrabble board

thin ice
he critiques her gravy
in front of the guest

sudden rainstorm
my place in another world
kept by a bookmark

Satie -
the rain
eases

Chinese market -
a row of small gold buddhas
share a smile

pension plans
the slow drone of a plane
coming in to land

strategic plan -
the sound of distant
foghorns

light rain -
water workers
dig a hole in the road

February sun -
a street light still on
in the daytime

the smell of varnish
lingers in the hall
like winter

Valentine's Day -
recycling
old gold

grey day
the only bright spot
a red traffic light

a hint of autumn 
that slight pause before she plucks
her first gray hair

cold rain
the greengrocer stacks cabbages
on cabbages

a window frames
the whole free world
in one white gull

between
the Prime Minister's words
birdsong

new year
fireworks
in a misty sky

late summer
graffiti overgrown
with ivy

evening sky
over fallen petals
a dark rose

a drop of ink -
tadpoles wriggle
on the water's surface

spring storm -
the grey dawn briefly
luminous

too soon the darkness
your last words lingering
in mist

moon and mist 
night settles into silence
and white breath

sweltering heat
the cicadas buzz louder
during her hot flash 

my dead mother's voice
on the answering machine
... again and again...

summer sunset
the slow glide of a heron
into shadows

young girls in fog 
the fleet movement of hands
fluffing tobacco

Chechnya 
blackened bones and ashes
smouldering

new leaves
pattered by rain...
cardinal song

new year...
a magpie turns over
an old leaf

chirping birds 
the instant I press
the stop button

Tonights light rainfall
Wraps me in soft silence
On my short walk home

examinations...
blank sheets as students
observe the falling leaves

marble moon...
the staccato of high heels
at rush hour

right turn
the clink of church keys
at the tea party

sampling my husband's
home-made wine...
autumn evening

stuck in traffic
dreaming of the monsoon
in a far-away land

at the window
the drumming of rain...
I catch up on sleep

this morning the sun
a fried egg on a plate
of blue china

doves
on the TV antenna
war on TV

winter window
closed to the cold -
purple orchid

sunflowers in bloom 
white flags
marking bodies

honeysuckle breeze
someone honks when
the light turns green

I wake beside
my daughter's sick bed
a howling dog

night of meteorites 
enjoying the sound of rain
instead

fall migration
custom combiners harvest
their way north

in winter's wind
the call of a friend
who now has cancer

harvest moon
i gather my thoughts
for winter

autumn melancholy
the click of mahjong tiles
from the computer

May clouds
new names and dates
in the family book

apricot blossoms
the birth of our first
granddaughter

blades of grass
between the flagstones...
Easter afternoon 

Monday moon
the bent backs
of rice farmers

spring morning
finding an old flame
on Facebook

spring evening
an old love letter
from my husband

summer traffic
four cars, a tractor
and the full moon

black ice
dad's last radiation
treatment 

mid February
the first garden seeds display
at the hardware store

winter night
too many stars
above Gaza

wall-to-wall clouds
and the hum of flies
summer dust

dead-end road
at the edge of the field
a new-born calf

harvest moon
the sound of women
pounding rice

winter evening
a teacup of mint
and moon

half moon
on the river the sound
of cracking ice

falling snow...
she brings his urn closer
to the window

attractive
even in red
an oak leaf

autumn mist...
what is she doing now
my mother?

September rain...
unaware of any pain
a peach falls

early sign of spring
snow shovels become
half-priced sale items

old temple
but all my prayers
are new

murmurings
in the old temple
summer wind

summer rain...
drinking tea to the cadence
of falling leaves

warm afternoon
a fly with nowhere
to go

flat moon...
an aspirine tablet and a
glass of water

the teacup
as empty as
my evening

a teacup
to fill
my afternoon

my day
measured out
in teaspoons

November moon
the last ball of cheese
in the fridge

The New Millenium
brought to my window
two new icycles

dark days of winter
the dentist explains his
payment plans

first spring snow
I release my soul in
my first yoga class

free floating
a tide full of shell fragments
and fireworks 

morning glories
find their way to the sun
on barbed wire

at half-mast
a butterfly passes by
the still flag

Origami

Those stars.
No more fish
in the bay.

apple slices-
our last words
in the knife's blade

no more war
two fighting beetles
on a tombstone

near the wall
of the cemetery
a condom

during the vigil
a withered flower
on the tiled floor

new age Luddite
he buys a dozen
paperback books 

a chill 
just before the drizzle
wind chime notes

rail track
amidst the corn fields
bisected infinity

chasing bubbles
near the floating moon
a paper boat

inching up
on the rainwashed eucalyptus
rising moon

dusty haze
at the sunrise time 
a yellow rose

daylight
in the winter haze
a faint birdsong

morning fog
my new dahlias too
look so faded 

between Lake Erie
and the nuclear station
fireflies

a dew drop 
full 
of autumn light

heavy leaves
in the evening rain
heaps of darkness

dark days of winter 
the flat screen Christmas Yule Log
burns bright in HD 

winter morning 
this egg and me
in the kitchen

persimmon tree
mallards drink in
its reflection

migratory pelicans...
the pollster presses
for an opinion

crescent moon
a young mockingbird
with its one song

fever dream
a bird chirps the refrain
from the latin mass

first frost
another wish
goes on their list

first frost
why did I never
plant evergreens?

harvest days
a fat toad
leaves the garden

the coming rain 
bird calls echo 
along the creek

early spring
pallets of fertilizer
on the loading dock

dark days of winter
another mailbox loses
to the snowplow

steeping tea
no more or less
of the thin snow

first snow
a dusting of flour
in the cake pans

cinco de mayo
I walk downhill to watch
the moon rise again

spring storm
overripe bananas
in the kitchen

evening thunder
robin calls echo
across the park

the barn doors open
dry leaves sweep
into the muddy yard

no moon
the individual
songs of crickets

passing monarchs 
a few leaves flutter
to the road

cicadas
at twilight
finally it rains

summer's end
an orange sunset
crayoned on the wall

dark days of winter
at my office window
I watch the sunrise

evening walk
same flickering glow
house to house

and snails

out of the cloud's shadow -
suddenly white

going south

the smell of a waffle
at the water's edge

the edge of the salt
at the foot of pants

with a big pencil -
the price
strawberries

the route of your nose
on glass

after sand galleries
our hands are joined

Snow sky -
buy a carrot
for man

the tips of the beans
on the obituary

an island
glossy swiped
under the door

Back to School -
in the hundreds
dead

the baker finally
seated

in the miror -
an earthy taste
in mouth

opening fishing
fancy lures
wrestling branches too

at table
it crumbles bread -
blackbird's eye

Army museum 
German helmets
attached

by the window -
a blue like that
our armchairs

balm -
to the source
in the rain

In the rain

Almost

applies lipstick

falls out of a bath towel

shows a different time

leaving home
the warmth still inside
my freshly ironed shirt

gray drizzle
for miles and miles
this road I'm on

liberty market
one free pickle
from the barrel

christmas album
every year he wears
the same flannel shirt

murmur of rain
hard to catch the words
when he talks in his sleep

what if
the flavor of burnt toast
is in the fallen seed
my desire for bitternut
despite its name*

moonless night
a spoonful of darkness
stirring my tea

bullfrog chorus
one a little louder
than the rest

lonesome train whistle...

than the photograph

the blur of reading
through tears

summer haze
the thin gauze
of her white dress

pale legs
under a white moon
shivering aspen

beach house
a bit of sand
in my tea

the pattern in your eyes
before death drained their color
and left you in that vacant room
to dream of open skies

in my black tea

of too many aspirin

in blue light
a yellow rose

sharp edges
of halfpipe -

last day of the year
- Traces of sleds rusty
in the snow yesterday

against the black trunk

a small hot pumpkin
in my palm

for each cricket chirp

its darkest colour

enters his hands

in old laundry

scudding clouds over
the cemetery wall

train whistle
a blackbird hops
along its notes

the moon is broken

from a train window

in the heartland her laughter
still fills the kitchen

on Henry VIII

of a bread knife

in the pumpkin soup

of the new year

from all directions

among hard drinkers

ebb tide-
they suddenly have
cold feet

along the mountain trail
garlic snores

the rain
almost a friend
this funeral

October wind
sweeping cobwebs
from the wood pile

dusty knickknacks
mother's whole life
on one shelf

sunlit helmet
the young soldier's eyes
invisible

endless rain
without opening
a crocus falls

evening coffeeâ€”
wisps of fog rise
from the bayou

the lilac in budâ€”
a cloud with storm in it
swells over the bay 

partly cloudyâ€”
I remember the face
but not the name

intertwined
in my washing machine,
my daughter's bras
and the jeans of
her latest boyfriend

false hope
a film of oil carries
bent rainbows downstream

whiskey moonâ€”
a morning after
at the bottleâ€™s end

a lake
brimming with mountainsâ€”
trout ripple the sky

mother-in-law's face
on the biggest pumpkin
harvest moon 

untwisting
the rose bud
spring rain

fireworks gone
Orion's beauty remains
in the stillness

solitary walk -
at nightfall the flash
of distant fireworks

stroke of midnight
the blast of foghorns
along the coast

after the rain
I check the growth
of each tulip

a lost dream
cellular phone
on the night train

Sunday morning
smells of French toast
and cinnamon...

drip.drip.drip.drip.drip.
the anticipation
of maple syrup

How thin the moon!
the scent of lilacs
grows fainter...

divorce hearing
we talk about
the rain

daybreak
the train graffiti drips
autumn dew

the slow drift...
sunbeam across
an empty room

in her eyes
the end our date
the moon

as she yells
stillness
of the ficus

in the lap
of a stone Buddha
fresh snow

divorce proceedings
our bed gets bigger
and bigger

silently day
becomes night
in this childless house

picking up his toys
still in my funeral clothes
the very last time
